Now you can learn Blackjack Basic Strategy in your car, on the plane, or even in your sleep! I have created several ways to
memorize the 281 decisions you need to know when playing perfect Basic Strategy. You can memorize the entire chart by listening
to my [Playlists on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jackacestudios) or by shuffling a video [Playlist on my YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCINg22R9y7_qrYXH1zWwIVQ)! These clips will present you with a specific play in
blackjack and follow up with the correct action shortly afterwards.

Best of all, everything is entirely **FREE**!

I have six playlists to cover all the different sets of Basic Strategy that you might want to learn, including Single, Double, and
4 or More Decks, as well as the two variations of the Hit/Stand on Soft 17 rule.

If you're a card counter, I even have the Illustrious 18 Deviations + the Fab 4 Surrender decisions for the High-Low counting system.

## Audio Flashcards

I'm currently hosting my audio tracks on Soundcloud. Remember to like the playlists and tracks if you can!
