I've owned the [jackace.com](https://jackace.com) domain name since 2002 and finally decided to do something with it after almost 20 years!

I'm a big fan of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so I decided to use it as the backbone of the site! It uses
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for markup and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments.

If you're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and GitHub Pages, you already know that you can contribute to my site by making
corrections or adding content and submitting a Pull Request. This site's repo is
[JackAce/jackace.com](https://github.com/JackAce/jackace.com).

This will be an educational site teaching donkeys like *YOU* about gambling, crypto, software, and math. My
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCINg22R9y7_qrYXH1zWwIVQ) will be the main source of content, and this
site/blog will help supplement it.

This is the first of many posts, so stay tuned!
