just setting up my jackace

## Welcome to JackAce.com!

I'm a big fan of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so I set up a site of my own! It uses Jekyll for markup and Disqus for comments.
If you're familiar with GitHub and GitHub Pages, you already know that you can contribute to my site by making corrections or adding content
and submitting a Pull Request. This site's repo is
[JackAce/jackace.com](https://github.com/JackAce/jackace.com).

I've owned the [jackace.com](https://jackace.com) domain name since 2002 and finally decided to do something with it after almost 20 years!

This will be an educational site teaching donkeys like *YOU* about gambling, and crypto, and the mathematics behind each. My
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCINg22R9y7_qrYXH1zWwIVQ) will be the main source of content, and this
site/blog will help supplement it.

This is the first of many posts, so stay tuned!
