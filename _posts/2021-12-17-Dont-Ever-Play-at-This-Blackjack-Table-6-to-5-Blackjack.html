<p>
    No, <i>"6-to-5 Blackjack"</i> isn't Blackjack that you play at 4:54pm. It is an atrocity and one of the worst things 
    to happen to blackjack in the past few <b>decades</b>.
</p>

<h2>What is 6-to-5 Blackjack?</h2>
<p>
    Remember when corporate America took that thing you loved and changed it into some horrible turd all in the name 
    greed? Maybe they took your sports team's iconic stadium and renamed it with their garbage name. Maybe they replaced 
    sugar in your favorite soda with high fructose corn syrup. Or maybe they took your favorite childhood movie and
    "rebooted it" with Will Smith playing a singing blue genie.
</p>
<p>
    Well, the corporate America has done it again. They've ruined blackjack.
</p>
<p>
    A few years back, something called "6-to-5 Blackjack" started showing up around casinos in Las Vegas. It looks
    and kinda feels almost like <i>real</i> Blackjack with one very large difference: The bonus when you receive a 
    Blackjack has been reduced by 60%.
</p>
<p>
    <b>SIXTY PERCENT!</b>
</p>
<p>
    In <i>Real Blackjack<sup>TM</sup></i>, if you make a $20 bet you'll receive an <b>extra $10</b>
    in addition to your $20 bet when you start with a two-card 21. In 6-to-5 Blackjack, you only win $6
    for every $5 you bet (hence <i>"6-to-5"</i>) for a total of $24. <b>That means the $10 bonus has been
    reduced to only $4</b>!
</p>

<h2>The House Edge of 6-to-5</h2>
<p>
    You can calculate the cost of playing 6-to-5 Blackjack pretty easily. To start, you need to know how frequently
    you can expect a starting hand of 21 and I promise it's easy to remember.
</p>
<p>
    On average, you will receive a blackjack once every 21 hands.
</p>
<p>
    So estimating the cost of this rule variant becomes pretty easy. Multiply the probability of having a Blackjack (1/21)
    by the probability of the dealer <i>not</i> having a Blackjack (1 - 1/21) and the change in your payout, which is 0.3
    of your initial bet (60% of your half-bet bonus) and you get:
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    {1 \over 21} \times {20 \over 21} \times 0.3 & \approx 0.0136054 \\
    & \approx 1.36054\%
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    And that's a very good approximation for the cost of this rule variant! When you look at the actual cost of the rule,
    it comes <i>very</i> close:

<h2>6-to-5 versus other Rule Variants</h2>
<p>
    So how does 6-to-5 Blackjack stack up against other rule variants and table conditions? Besides the 
    6-to-5 payout change, the next biggest change would be moving from Single Deck Blackjack to 8 deck
    Blackjack: 0.47805%. This is almost <b>A THIRD</b> of the penalty for 6-to-5!
</p>
<p>
    Since the number of decks is more of a table condition change, not a rule change, what is the rule 
    change with the largest affect on the house edge? Hitting instead of Standing on a Soft 17 will
    cost the player 0.19% in house advantage. This makes the 6-to-5 rule more than <b>6 TIMES WORSE</b>
    than the next highest rule change.
</p>
<h2>We could all use a little Chaaaaaange...</h2>
<p>
    One aspect of 6-to-5 Blackjack that I almost <i>never</i> hear discussed is the affect on your chip
    stack. After you receive your first Blackjack, you usually have to start a new stack of oddly colored
    chips that don't match your main betting stack. For example, if you usually bet $10 per hand, you will 
    usually have all red $5 chips, but when you get a blackjack, now you need to start a new stack of $1
    chips because you got paid two $5 red chips and two $1 white chips.
</p>
<p>
    This means that you will often have this weird stack of odd chips that you can't intermingle with your
    main betting stack. It's not enough to make a full bet, so it just sits there, unspent.
</p>
<p>
    In <i>Real</i> Blackjack, it's pretty easy to keep your chips a consistent color. If you're betting
    multiples of $10, you'll just receive an odd red $5 chip that you can stack with the rest. Even if you're
    betting an odd amount (say multiples of $25), you only have to wait until you get a second Blackjack,
    where your 50% Blackjack bonus will allow you to construct a full bet with your odd chips.
</p>

<h2>Why do People Play 6-to-5 Blackjack?</h2>
<p>
    Because, like you, these people are <i>Donkeys</i>. But you're here, so at least you're trying to
    <i>do</i> something about it!
</p>
<p>
    There are three main reasons why people play this horrible game.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Combining the rule change with Single Deck Blackjack
        </li>
        <li>
            Combining the rule change with lower table limits
        </li>
        <li>
            Pure ignorance
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Single Deck</h3>
<p>
    The 6-to-5 payout is often combined with the offering of Single Deck Blackjack. This is the carrot casinos
    offer before beating you with their stick.
</p>
<p>
    As we have already discussed, the 6-to-5 payout penalty dwarfs the benefit of switching from 6 Deck to Single Deck. 
    Also, when you combine the two rule changes, the 6-to-5 has an even <i>HIGHER</i> penalty, because the main reason 
    why a lower number of decks is beneficial to the player is because you can expect a slightly higher frequency of 
    getting blackjacks. With the lower 6-to-5 payout, the benefits of single-deck are Nerfed.
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    EV_{single deck} + EV_{6 to 5} & < EV_{singledeck + 6 to 5} \\
    0.45742 + -1.36504 & < -0.93736 \\
    -0.90762 & < -0.93736 \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    As you can see, the change in EV is <i>greater than</i> the sum of the two conditions applied independently.
</p>
<h3>Lower Limit Tables</h3>
<p>
    I've heard people say that 6-to-5 is good because it offers a way for casinos to offer Blackjack to players 
    who can't afford the higher limit <i>Real</i> Blackjack tables.
</p>
<p>
    I strongly disagree. This would be like making cars with seatbelts made of dental floss so that poorer people
    can afford them. 6-to-5 is simply not blackjack, and trying to hook people on Blackjack by giving them a
    crappy version is only going to result in fewer people gradutating to the higher stakes tables.
</p>
<h3>Ignorance</h3>
<p>
    The biggest reason people end up playing these tables is pure ignorance. Not just ignorance, but complete
    indifference. Unfortunately, gambling is becoming less and less of an attraction for tourists.
</p>

<h2>Jack's Final Thought</h2>
<p>
    6-to-5 Blackjack isn't real Blackjack. In fact, a group of Blackjack players sued casinos in
    Massachusetts

    lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

    https://www.legitgamblingsites.com/blog/why-blackjack-players-lost-a-lawsuit-over-65-payouts/

    I'm not trying to say that 6-to-5 Blackjack is the worst offering casinos have ever made. Slot Machines 
    and Roulette probably win this prize hands down. The reason why I object to the introduction of 
    6-to-5 Blackjack is becuase it will (and has been) pave the way towards even more horrendous rules
    that are even worse for the consumer.
</p>
<p>
    We've already seen this with God-awful changes like <b>Triple-Zero Roulette</b>.
</p>
<p>
    It seems like consumers have decided that they simply do not care about blah blah blah...
</p>
