    Don't ever cover more than 35 numbers in Roulette! Some or even ALL of your bets may end up being worthless!
</p>

<h2>What is "Bet Nullification"?</h2>
<p>
    Some people <i>really</i> like to spread their bets around the Roulette table. They don't just make one or two
    bets covering a small section of the table, they go hogwild, taking up a ton of real estate on the felt.
    They're hedging their bets to increase their chances of getting paid, even though it results in a smaller
    overall payout.
</p>
<p>
    But if you end up spreading yourself <i>too</i> thin, you can put yourself in a situation where it becomes 
    <b>IMPOSSIBLE</b> to win. This is easy to see if you bet boths sides of an even money bet (When you bet on
    18 numbers at a time).
</p>
<p>
    For example, you could bet $100 on Red AND $100 on Black and \(36 \over 38\) (94.7%) of the time you'll end
    up with no gain and no loss. In this case, when the Roulette ball lands on any number between
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" width="40"/>
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/36_r.svg" alt="36 Red" width="40"/>, your $100 winning bet
    will cancel out your $100 losing bet.
</p>
<p>
    But when you hit the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" width="40"/>
    or the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" width="40"/>, you'll
    lose <b>ALL $200</b>!
</p>

        <figcaption>If you cover 36 numbers you might not have <b>ANY</b> way to win.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    This is a result of <i>Bet Nullification</i> (I made this term up). Whenever the win from one bet completely cancels
    out the losses of another bet or set of bets, there is zero upside to making the bets at all.
</p> 
<p>
    And creating a Bet Nullification situation is a mathematical <i>certainty</i> once you hit the threshold of
    betting on 36 different numbers.
</p> 
<p>
    The Red/Black bet example is an <i>EXTREMELY</i> simple example of how you could make bets that nullify each
    other, but are there bet combinations that are more difficult to identify?
</p> 

<h2>Covering 36 Numbers with Inside AND Outside Bets</h2>
<p>
    I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo">CEG Dealer School's</a>
    YouTube channel recently and they were playing a system called "DIAMOND HEIST!" where they made the
    following bets:
</p> 
<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-24/roulette-bets.png" alt="Roulette Bets" height="300" />
        <figcaption>
            "ðŸ’Ž HEIST!" Roulette System <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=94s">tested
            and reviewed by CEG Dealer School</a>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    It may not be instantly apparent, but they managed to spread $95 across all 36 Natural (non-zero) numbers.
</p> 
<p>
    And it's tough to see exactly <i>how much</i> of the $95 is being wasted, but it is <b>A LOT</b>. In fact,
    $45 of the $95 is cancelling itself out (47.3%!).
</p> 
<p>
    To identify the bet overlaps, we can apply
    the <i>Commutative Betting Property</i> of Roulette (I made this term up as well), which states that:
</p> 
<blockquote>
    Betting $X on an n-number bet is equivalent to Betting \(\$X \over n\) on each of the covered numbers straight-up
</blockquote> 
<p>
    For example, betting $3 on the first Street
    (<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" width="40"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" alt="2 Black" width="40"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" alt="3 Red" width="40"/>) is the same as betting
    $1 each on the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" width="40"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" alt="2 Black" width="40"/> and
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" alt="3 Red" width="40"/>.
</p> 
<p>
    Applying this to all of the bets in the original system, we can reproduce it with the following bets:
</p> 
<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-24/roulette-bets-v2.png" alt="Roulette Bets (Equivalent)" height="300" />
        <figcaption>The same payouts and losses can be reproduced with this betting scheme</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    Once we spread the bets out like this, it's easy to see that we're needlessly betting $1.25 on <i>EVERY NUMBER</i>!
    Multiplying that by 36, we can see we're wasting $45 of the $95 being bet!
</p>
<p>
    So if we subtract $1.25 from every spot, our total amount bet will 
    be $50 and our bets will look like this:
</p>
<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-24/roulette-bets-v3.png" alt="Roulette Bets (OPTIMAL)" height="300" />
        <figcaption>Every payout in this modified system has the same payout as the original system, except you save $45 when it hits 0 and 00</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    So with this betting scheme, <i>EVERY SINGLE PAYOUT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM</i> - with the
    exception of the losses on <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" width="40"/>
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" width="40"/>. When the Zeroes hit,
    you only lose $50 instead of the original $95.
</p>
<p>
    And if you're looking at these bets and you're thinking that a casino won't let you bet these fractional amounts, 
    that's true. And it just so happens that we can rearrage all these bets and come up with the following bets that 
    a casino <i>will</i> allow.
</p>

        <figcaption>The Commutative Property of Roulette also allows you to roll up bets</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    And this makes sense if you understand what bets were removed. We've pulled $15 off the 3rd column and we've taken
    down $30 in 6 corner bets that makes up the first two columns. Those 6 bets could have been replicated by putting
    $15 on the 1st column and $15 on the 2nd column, and then getting rid of the $45 of nullified bets becomes trivial.
</p>

        <figcaption>Removed bets are displayed here in yellow</figcaption>

</p>

<h2>Protect Yourself</h2>
<p>
    So if you <i>ever</i> find yourself betting on 36 different numbers, you should know that you've triggered a
    Bet Nullification situation and that you should try to identify the nullified bets so that you can remove them
    from the table. You'll save yourself a lot of EV with zero downside!
