    Don't ever cover more than 35 numbers in Roulette! Some or even ALL of your bets may end up being worthless!
</p>

<h2>What is "Bet Nullification"?</h2>
<p>
    Some people <i>really</i> like to spread their bets around the Roulette table. They don't just make one or two
    bets covering a small section of the table, they go hogwild, taking up a ton of real estate on the felt.
    They're hedging their bets to increase their chances of getting paid, even though it results in a smaller
    overall payout.
</p>
<p>
    But if you end up spreading yourself <i>too</i> thin, you can put yourself in a situation where it becomes 
    <b>IMPOSSIBLE</b> to win. This is easy to see if you bet boths sides of an even money bet (When you bet on
    18 numbers at a time).
</p>
<p>
    For example, you could bet $100 on Red AND $100 on \(36 \over 38\) or 94.7% of the time you'll end up exactly
    where you started. For example, when it lands on
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" width="40"/>
    through <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/36_r.svg" alt="36 Red" width="40"/>, your winning bet
    will cancel out your losing bet.
</p>
<p>
    But when you hit the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" width="40"/>
    or the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" width="40"/>, you'll
    lose <b>ALL $200</b>!
</p>

        <figcaption>If you cover 36 numbers you might not have <b>ANY</b> way to win.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    This is a result of "Bet Nullification". When ever one bet cancels out the wins of another bet or set of bets, there is
    zero upside to making the bets at all.
</p> 
<p>
    This is an <i>EXTREMELY</i> simple example of how you could make bets that nullify each other, but are there
    bet combinations that are more difficult to identify?
</p> 

<h2>Covering 36 Numbers with Inside AND Outside Bets</h2>
<p>
    I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=94s">CEG Dealer School's</a>
    YouTube channel recently and they were playing a system called "DIAMOND HEIST!" where they made the
    following bets:
</p> 
<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-24/roulette-bets.png" alt="Roulette Bets" height="300" />
        <figcaption>
            "ðŸ’Ž HEIST!" Roulette System <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=94s">tested
            and reviewed by CEG Dealer School</a>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    It may not be instantly apparent, but they managed to spread $95 across all 36 natural (Non-zero) numbers.
</p> 
<p>
    And it's tough to see exactly <i>how much</i> of the $95 is being wasted, but it is <b>A LOT</b>. In fact,
    $45 of the $95 is cancelling itself out (47.3%!).
</p> 
<p>
    To identify the bet overlaps, we can apply
    the <i>Commutative Betting Property<sup>TM</sup></i> of Roulette (I made this term up as well), which states that:
</p> 
<blockquote>
    Betting $X on an n-number bet is equivalent to Betting \(\$X \over n\) on each of the covered numbers straight-up
</blockquote> 
<p>
    For example, betting $3 on the first Street
    (<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" width="40"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" alt="2 Black" width="40"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" alt="3 Red" width="40"/>) is the same as betting
    $1 each on the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" width="40"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" alt="2 Black" width="40"/> and
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" alt="3 Red" width="40"/>.
</p> 
<p>
    Applying this to all of the bets in the original system, we can reproduce it with the following bets:
</p> 
<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-24/roulette-bets-v2.png" alt="Roulette Bets (Equivalent)" height="300" />
        <figcaption>The same payouts and losses can be reproduced with this betting scheme</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    Once we spread the bets out like this, it's easy to see that we're needlessly betting $1.25 on <i>EVERY NUMBER</i>!
    Multiplying that by 36, we can see we're wasting $45 of the $95 being bet!
</p>
<p>
    So if we subtract $1.25 from every spot, our total amount bet will 
    be $50 and our bets will look like this:
</p>
<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-24/roulette-bets-v3.png" alt="Roulette Bets (OPTIMAL)" height="300" />
        <figcaption>Every single number has the same payout, except you save $45 when it hits 0 and 00</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    So with this betting scheme, <i>EVERY SINGLE PAYOUT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM</i> - with the
    exception of the losses on <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" width="40"/>
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" width="40"/>. When the Zeroes hit,
    you only lose $50 instead of the original $95.
</p>

<h2>Protect Yourself</h2>
<p>
    So if you <i>ever</i> find yourself betting on 36 different numbers, you should know that you've triggered a
    Bet Nullification situation and that you should consider taking some money off the table to fix it
</p> 
<p>
    It's a little tricky in this specific situation because the optimal bets are fractional amounts, which wouldn't
    be possible in a real-world situation, but if you multiply all bets (including the original system), then you can
    get whole dollar bet sizes.
</p>
