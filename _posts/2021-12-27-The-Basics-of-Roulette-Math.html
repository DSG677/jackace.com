<p>
    Have you ever wanted to learn the basics of Roulette math in just a few minutes? No? Well, too bad,
    because I'm going to teach them to you anyway! The good news for you is that the basics are dead
    simple, and I promise it'll be painless.
</p>

<h2>Eyeballling Payouts</h2>
<p>
    If you're learning starting your Roulette education from scratch, the first thing you'll need to learn 
    is the payouts for the various bets available. You can wager on 1 to up to 18 numbers on a single bet
    and each wager pays out at different odds depending on your chances of winning.
</p>
<p>
    Luckily, it's easy to figure out the payouts of each of these bets, and you don't even need to learn a
    complicated formula to do so. For most of the bets, you can determine the payout by eyeballing the 
    layout and slicing and dicing it visually as we're about to do.
</p>
<p>
    The trick is knowing that there would be <i>ZERO</i> house advantage if there were no Zeroes. That
    means that if you were to make the same bet multiple times until you've bet on all the numbers that
    aren't <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="0 Green" /> 
    or <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="00 Green" />,
    then your winning bets would be paid off by all of your losing bets, leaving you with no gain and no
    loss.
</p>
<p>
    So to figure out how much each bet pays out, just keep making the same type of bet until you've bet
    on all 36 numbers (being careful not to overlap the bets) and recognize that the number of losing
    bets is what your payout would need to be to pay off the winning bet.
</p>
<h3>1 Number Bet: "Straight-Up"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-30/roulette-01-straight-up-601x291.png" alt="35 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>35 losing bets pay the winning bet (35:1). The green background represents the potential winning spin and the red
    background represents the losing bets that would be needed to pay off the winning bet.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    There are 36 non-zero numbers. So if you bet on all 36 "Straight-Up" bets, your spin will have one
    winner (again, we're assuming no zeroes) and 35 losers. So for there to be no house advantage with 
    our zeroless wheel, the Straight-Up bet needs to pay 35 to 1.
</p>
<h3>2 Number Bet: "Split"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-30/roulette-02-split-601x291.png" alt="17 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>17 losing bets pay the winning bet (17:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You can make 18 "Split" bets (with no overlap) to cover up the entire non-zero field. So the 17 losing bets
    will pay off the winning bet, and this 2-number bet pays 17 to 1. It's possible for Split bets to overlap,
    so make sure your bets are evenly distributed.
</p>
<h3>3 Number Bet: "Street"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-30/roulette-03-street-601x291.png" alt="11 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>11 losing bets pay the winning bet (11:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You can bet on all 12 "Streets" (each street is the horizontal row), and the 11 losing bets will pay off the
    one winner at a rate of 11 to 1.
</p>
<h3>4 Number Bet: "Corner"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-30/roulette-04-corner-601x291.png" alt="8 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>The 4-number bets (striped regions) along the top are not possible Corner bets, but are included here to illustrate coverage of the table</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    OK - this one is a little tricky, so you kind of have to <i>warp</i> the definition of a "Corner" bet.
    You can't cover all 36 numbers exclusively with Corner bets without having <i>some</i> overlap or
    double-coverage of some of the numbers. But if you somehow could (for example, if you could make a
    "Corner" bet on the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/9_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="9 Red" />, &amp;
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/12_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="12 Red" />),
    the 8 losing bets would pay off the winning bet at 8 to 1.
</p>
<h3>5 Number Bet: "Basket"</h3>
<p>
    We're going to skip this bet for now. It's the only bet that doesn't follow this same rule, and
    consequently, it's the only bet that doesn't offer fair odds on our mythical non-zero layout.
</p>
<h3>6 Number Bet: "Double-Street"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-30/roulette-06-double-street-601x291.png" alt="5 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>5 losing bets pay the winning bet (5:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Pays 5 to 1. Hopefully, you've figured out how this works by now.
</p>
<h3>12 Number Bet: "Dozen" or "Column"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-30/roulette-12-dozen-601x291.png" alt="2 losing bets pay the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>2 losing bets pay the winning bet (2:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Pays 2 to 1.
</p>
<h3>18 Number Bet: "Red"/"Black", "Even"/"Odd", "1st Half"/"2nd Half"</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-30/roulette-18-even-money-601x291.png" alt="Losing bet pays the winning bet" />
    <figcaption>Losing bet pays the winning bet (1:1)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Pays 1 to 1 (even money).
</p>

<h2>The Payout Formula</h2>
<p>
    If you're not a visual person like me and you <i>don't</i> want to visualize the Roulette betting layout
    every time you want to calculate the payouts, you can just use the following formula:
</p>
<p class="cell-center">
    \begin{align}
    { Payout_{n-number-bet} } = { {36 \over n } - 1 } \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    And this is easy to understand because it's the formulaic representation of the slicing and dicing we saw
    above.
</p>
<p>
    We took the 36 number layout, divided it by the number of sectors we want to bet on at a time (<i>n</i>)
    and then subtracted the 1 winning bet to see how many losing bets we need to pay off the winner.
</p>
<p>
    So for you non-visual learners, here's a table with all the calculations you need to determine the
    payouts:
</p>
<table class="condensed-table">

<h2>Calculating the House Advantage</h2>
<p>
    Since we know that a zeroless Roulette wheel has no house advantage
    (for all bets besides the 5-number bet), we can simply calculate the
    house edge by calculating the probability of hitting any of the zeroes
    on the wheel.
</p>
<table class="condensed-table">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Wheel Type
        </th>
        <th>
            Probability
        </th>
        <th>
            House Advantage %
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            Single Zero
        </td>
        <td class="cell-center">

            \( 3 \over 39 \)
        </td>

            7.69%
        </td>
    </tr>

<h2>That Pesky 5-Number "Basket" Bet</h2>
<p>
    To calculate the house advantage of <i>any</i> bet, you can use the more generic formula:
</p>
<p class="cell-center">
    \begin{align}
    { Advantage_{n-number-bet} } & = { { 36 - n - (n \times p) + z } \over { 36 + z } }
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Where <i>n</i> is the number of numbers covered, <i>p</i> is the payout for the n-number bet, and
    <i>z</i> is the number of zeroes on the wheel.
</p>
<p>
    And for all the bets we've covered so far, the \(\color{#009bb0}36 - n - (n \times p)\) portion of the formula has always been
    equal to 0. This is why there is no house advantage in a zeroless wheel.
</p>
<p>
    But since the number 5 doesn't divide evenly into 36, it's not possible to have a fair payout that is a nice
    round integer. That's why casinos short-change you on the payout of this bet by only paying you 6-to-1 instead
    of 6.2-to-1, making the 5-number bet the Red-Headed Step-child of Roulette Bets.
</p>
<p>
    So, to calculate the house edge of the basket bet on the Double Zero wheel, we get
</p>
<p class="cell-center">
    \begin{align}
    { Advantage_{basket} } & = { { 36 - 5 - (5 \times 6) + 2 } \over { 36 + 2 } } \\
    \\
    & = { { 36 - 5 - 30 + 2 } \over 38 } \\
    \\
    & = { 3 \over 38 } \\
    \\
    & = 7.89\% \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    And here is the house edge on the 5-number bet for the various wheel configurations:
</p>
<table class="condensed-table">
    <tr>
        <th>
            Wheel Type
        </th>
        <th>
            House Edge of Basket Bet
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            Single Zero
        </td>
        <td class="cell-center">
            <i>Basket Bet not possible</i>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            Double Zero
        </td>
        <td class="cell-center">
            \( { 1 + 2 \over 38 } = { 7.89\% } \)
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cell-center">
            Triple Zero
        </td>
        <td class="cell-center">
            \( { 1 + 3 \over 39 } = { 10.26\% } \)
        </td>
    </tr>

<h2>Roulette versus Other Table Games</h2>
<p>
    So, now you know the house edge for Roulette. In the US (where Double Zero wheels are the norm),
    it's 5.26% per bet. And that's a lot.
</p>
<p>
    The house advantage for 6-deck Blackjack is only about 0.42% if you play perfect Basic Strategy,
    making Roulette <b>12 and a half times worse</b> than 6 deck Blackjack.
</p>
<p>
    And what does this mean in terms of your hourly loss for Roulette?
</p>
<p>
    Besides the Roulette's horrendous house edge, it's also plagued by rate at which you can place bets.
    The number of players at the table affects the number of spins per hour that they can accomodate. More
    players means more people exchanging cash for chips, more people to pay out, and more people to wait
    for as they decide on which bets to make.
</p>
<p>
    For the most part, each player performs their actions independently. They spread their chips around
    the table in parallel and in concert with the other patrons. It's like waiting for towels to dry. If
    it takes a towel 1 hour to dry, it doesn't take 10 towels 10 hours to dry. They each take the same
    amount and that time passes for all 10 towels concurrently.
</p>
<p>
    But some actions require serial attention. When a single dealer has to color up 5 people, it can't
    happen in parallel.
</p>

<h2>You are Now a Roulette Math Expert!</h2>
<p>
    Congratulations! You now know everything you need to know about Roulette Math!
</p>
<p>
    And...full disclosure - I've never actually sat down at a Roulette table. I may have slapped
    a few bucks on a single straight-up bet while trying to avoid a trip to the casino cage, but
    I've never actually sat down and given the dealer cash in exchange for a stack of chips that
    I made more than a single wager with.
</p>
<p>
    But I've actually spent a lot of time analyzing Roulette and the various bets you can make. There's
    really not a lot to this game and I think the draw to the game is its simplicity. Of course, casinos
    recognize that the game's draw is its simplicity and it is their reason for charging American patrons
    with an <i>EXORBITANT</i> house edge of 5.26% (Most of the world is smart enough to only tolerate the
    single zero Roulette wheel, which only has a 2.7% house advantage).
</p>
<p>
    So, now that you're an expert, hopefully you recognize that Roulette is one of the absolute
    <i>WORST</i> games out there for the average player.
