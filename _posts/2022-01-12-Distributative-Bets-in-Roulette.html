<p>
    If you're the type of person who likes to spread their bets around the Roulette table, you should know 
    about <i>the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</i>. It can save you a lot of time, hassle, and
    awkwardness if your bets can be consolidated into larger multi-number bets.
</p>

<h2>What is the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting?</h2>
<p>
    The Distributive Property of Roulette Betting states
</p>
<blockquote>
    Betting $X on an n-number bet is equivalent to betting \($X \over n\) each of the n-numbers Straight-up.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Which can be represented formulaically as
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \({$X \times Payout_n} = n \times {$X \over n} \times Payout_1 \)
</p>
<p>
    Where \(\color{#8acdd8}Payout_n\) is the payout multiplier for an n-number bet (when \(n \neq 5\)).
</p>
<p>
    So betting $6 on the 6-number "Double Street" is equivalent to making six $1 bets on each of the
    covered numbers individually.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        These two betting configurations are equivalent.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Does this really work?</h3>
<p>
    If we look at the two sets of wagers above, we can easily see that hitting any number outside of
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    will
    result in a <span class="amt-neg">$6</span> loss. But what happens when we hit a number between
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />?
</p>
<p>
    With the single $6 Double Street bet, we win 5-to-1, for a <b>net win of $30</b>.
</p>
<p>
    With the six $1 Straight-up bets, we will lose $5, but win $35 on the Straight-up bet, for a
    <b>net win of $30</b>.
</p>
<p>
    So in <i>both</i> scenarios, we lose <span class="amt-neg">$6</span> when we miss and win
    <span class="amt-pos">$30</span> when we hit.
</p>
<p>
    And this Distributive Property of Roulette Bets works with <i>any</i> combination of bets where the bets
    are all uniform. So you can consolidate three Straight-up bets into a 3-number Street bet. And you can
    consolidate four Straight-up bets into one 4-number Corner bet. You can even consolidate two Street bets
    into a single Double Street bet.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        These are all equivalent decompositions of the $6 Double Street bet.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And this works for <i>all</i> bets with the exception of the 5 number (Basket) bet, which is a bet on
    the numbers
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="0 Green" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="00 Green" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />, and
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />.
</p>
<h2>What is this Sorcery?</h2>
<p>
    This all magically works out because all Roulette Bets (besides that pesky 5-number bet) have the same
    house edge (<span class="amt-bad">5.26%!</span>). This means if you bet the same amount on n spots, your Expected Value (EV) should be
    <i>exactly the same</i> if you bet that same amount on and n-number bet. 
</p>
<p>
    And we can prove this mathematcially using one of the formulas I've introduced in my post on the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/29/The-Basics-of-Roulette-Math/">Basics of Roulette Math</a>.
    The payout for every bet in Roulette (besides the 5 number "Basket" bet) can be calculated by using
    the formula:
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    $$ { Payout_n } = { {36 - n} \over n } $$
</p>

<p>
    So an $n wager on an n-number bet can be calculated as
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    n \times { Payout_n } & = { n \times { {36 - n} \over n } } \\
    \\
    & = 36 - n \\
    \\
    & = 36 - 1 - n + 1 \\
    \\
    & = { {36 - 1} \over 1 } - (n - 1) \\
    \\
    & = { Payout_1 } - (n - 1) \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Which is the win from a single $1 Straight-up bet minus the <i>(n-1)</i> losses from the losing
    Straight-up bets.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you bet $1 on 12 numbers Straight-up, then one of those bets will win $35 and 11 of those
    bets will lose, for a net win of $24, which is what your 2-to-1 payout would be for betting $12 on a dozen
    or column.
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    $12 \times { Payout_{12} } & = { Payout_1 } - (12 - 1) \\
    \\
    $12 \times 2 & = $35 - $11 \\
    \\
    $24 & = $24 \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Here's the formula applied to all 7 bet types (without the Basket bet):

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
    If you've never heard of the <i>Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</i>, it's probably because I
    just made up the name. I've recently been analyzing some Roulette betting systems and realized how a lot
    of them waste time by making you sprinkle bets needlessly all over the layout. I've never seen this
    property formally discussed anywhere, so I thought I'd give it a name.
</p>
<p>
    So, with that being said, let me also introduce you to some of the other terms involved in this property
    that you may have already figured out.
</p>

<h3>Consolidation</h3>
<p>
    <i>Consolidation</i> is "rolling-up" individual bets into a single bet with the same win/loss characteristics.
    A typical consolidation is taking n number of $X bets into a single $Nx n-number bet.
</p>
<h3>Distribution/Decomposition</h3>
<p>
    <i>Distribution</i> or <i>Decomposition</i> is taking a multi-number bet and breaking it down into smaller bets,
    often a series of "Straight-up" single-number bets.
</p>
<p>
    It's also possible to decompose a multi-number bet into smaller multi-number bets. For example, a $12
    double-street bet can be broken down into two $6 street bets. Or it could be broken down into one $6 street
    bet and three $2 Straight-up bets. Or it could be broken down into an $8 Corner bet and a $4 Split bet.
</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXDxNCzUspM" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-12/first-citiwide-change-bank-600x392.png" alt="We will work with you..." /></a>
    <figcaption>
        You can break down a multi-number bet in many different ways.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Density</h3>
<p>
    <i>Density</i> or <i>Betting Density</i> is the bet amount per spot once a multi-number bet has
    been fully distributed to single-number bets. You can also think of this as the <i>equity</i> per spot.
</p>
<p>
    In order for two betting scenarios to be equivalent, their betting density must be equal for the covered
    area. For example, you can bet $6 on the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    Double Street, but that would have a different density
    compared to betting $3 on the 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/4_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="4 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/5_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="5 Red" />
    Corner Bet in conjunction with a $3
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    Split Bet. This implies that the two betting schemes are not equivalent and will pay out
    differently when the numbers hit.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-12/roulette-04-drake-1242x1586.png" alt="Drake knows what's up. Make sure the betting density is consistent, or Distributive Property won't apply." />
    <figcaption>
        The densities must be consistent. The $3 + $3 bets are unevenly spread out, so the overall payout
        will be higher if you hit the 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> or
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/4_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="4 Black" />
        (<span class="amt-pos">$48</span>) over hitting the 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />,
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />, 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/5_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="5 Red" />, or
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />,
        (<span class="amt-pos">$21</span>).
        <br/>
        With the $2 + $4 bets, the payout is consistently <span class="amt-pos">$30</span>, which is
        identical to the payout for the $6 Double Street bet.
    </figcaption>

<h2>How can I make use of the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting?</h2>
<p>
    I've been watching a lot of Roulette system reviews on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CEGDealerSchool">CEG Dealer School's YouTube Channel</a>, and I've
    noticed that the systems submittied by viewers are often impractical when it comes to betting at a
    brick and mortar casino.
</p>
<p>
    These systems may seem enjoyable on paper or even tapping your finger on a Roulette iPad app, but it's
    often extremely impractical to be betting on spots all over a real-world table, since you may have to
    reach over other people. These systems also often require betting odd amounts if there's any
    Martingale-style "doubling-up" involved when you lose.
</p>
<p>
    But if you can consolidate your bets using the Distributive Property of Roulette
    Betting, you can often save time and prevent yourself from encroaching awkwardly into
    other people's personal space. On a Roulette table,
    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=reacharound" target="_blank">reach-arounds</a>
    are a bad thing.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-12/roulette-01-ceg-800x372.png" alt="Alex at CEG Dealer School bets $30 on the first two columns" />
    <figcaption>
        In CEG Dealer School's review of the system named
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=80s">"Diamond Heist"</a>, they bet $30
        across 6 corner bets that are spread evenly across the first two columns. They could have just
        put $15 on Column 1 and $15 on Column 2, saving time and the dreaded "reach around" -
        stretching their arms awkwardly across the felt and annoying other players.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    A few days ago, The CEG Dealer School reviewed a Roulette system named
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=80s">"Diamond Heist"</a>, where they made
    6 corner bets that covered the entire first two columns. For the purposes of this post, we're
    going to ignore the other bets involved in this system.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-12/roulette-02-ceg-800x387.png" alt="6 Corner Bets covering the first two columns." />
    <figcaption>
        The 6 bets in question in the "Diamond Heist" Roulette system.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    So, there is $30 covering the first two columns evenly (with a betting density of $1.25 per spot). This
    is the perfect candidate for consolidation! Since there's no "Double Column" bet, we can instead place
    $15 on each of the first two column bets.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-12/roulette-03-ceg-800x387.png" alt="These two $15 bets are easier to make." />
    <figcaption>
        It's easier to make two $15 on one side of the felt rather than spread $30 all across the table,
        especially when the table is full.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    We've saved ourselves some time and we've eliminated the awkward "reach-around"! This is what
    the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting is all about!
</p>
<p>
    And it's important to understand this property before we advance to future topics. WIP FINISH THIS CONCLUSION
</p>
