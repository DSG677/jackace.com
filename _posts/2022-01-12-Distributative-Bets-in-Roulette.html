    If you're the type of person who likes to spread their bets around the Roulette table, you should know 
    about the Distributive Property of Roulette Bets. It can save you a lot of time and hassle if your bets
    are consolidated in certain areas.
</p>

<h2>What is the Distributive Property of Roulette Bets?</h2>
<p>
    The Distributive Property of Roulette states
</p>
<blockquote>
    Betting $X on an n-number bet is equivalent to betting \($X \over n\) each the covered numbers straight-up.
</blockquote>
<p>
    In other words
</p>
<blockquote>
    \({$X \times Payout_n} = {$X \over n} \times Payout_1 \)
</blockquote>
<p>
    Where \(Payout_n\) is the payout multiplier for an n-number bet
</p>
<p>
    So betting $6 on the 6-number bet, is equivalent to betting $1 on each of the numbers individually.
</p>
<p>

        <figcaption>The numbers 1-6 bet straight-up ("distributed" or "decomposed" bets)</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    If we look at the two sets of wagers above, we can easily see that hitting any number outside of
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    will
    result in a $6 loss. But what happens when we hit a number between
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />?
</p>
<p>
    With the single $6 Double Street bet, we win 5-to-1, for a net win of $30.
</p>
<p>
    With the six $1 Straight-up bets, we will lose $5, but win $35 on the straight-up bet, for a net win of $30.
</p>
<p>
    So in <i>both</i> scenarios, we lose $6 when we miss and win $30 when we hit.
</p>
<p>
    And this Distributive Property of Roulette Bets works with any combination of bets where the bets are all
    uniform. So you can consolidate three straight-up bets into a 3 number Street bet. And you can consolidate 
    four straight-up bets into one 4 number Corner bet. You can even consolidate two Street bets into a single
    Double Street bet.
</p>

            <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />, and
            <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />
            bet straight-up
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>

            <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
            <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />
            Street bet
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    And this works for <i>all</i> bets with the exception of the 5 number (Basket) bet, which is a bet on the numbers
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="0 Green" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="00 Green" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />, and
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />.
</p>
<h2>What is this Sorcery?</h2>
<p>
    This all magically works out because all Roulette Bets would be "fair" (i.e. There would be no House Edge) if There
    were no Zeroes on the wheel. So as long as your <i>density</i> of bets is consistent (the amount of money bet evenly across
    numbers), then the payout should be identical.
</p>
<p>
    And we can prove this mathematcially. The payout for every bet in Roulette (besides the 5 number "Basket" bet) can
    be calculated by using the formula:
</p>
<p>
    $$ { Payout_{n-number-bet} } = { {36 - n} \over n } $$

            35:1 - $0 = $35 for $1
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    So an $n wager on an n-number bet can be calculated as
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    n \times { Payout_n } & = { n \times { {36 - n} \over n } } \\
    \\
    & = 36 - n \\
    \\
    & = 36 - 1 - n + 1 \\
    \\
    & = { {36 - 1} \over 1 } - (n - 1) \\
    \\
    & = { Payout_1 } - (n - 1) \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Which is the win from a single $1 straight-up bet minus the (n-1) losses from the losing straight-up bets.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you bet $1 on 12 numbers straight-up, then one of those bets will win $35 and 11 of those
    bets will lose, for a net win of $24, which is what your payout would be for betting $12 on a dozen or a
    column.
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    $12 \times { Payout_{12} } & = { Payout_1 } - (12 - 1) \\
    \\
    $12 \times 2 & = $35 - $11 \\
    \\
    $24 & = $24 \\
    \end{align}

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
    To tell you the truth, I've never heard of the <i>Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</i>. In
    fact, I just made the term up. That doesn't make it any less valid, though. It works and I've proven
    that it works, so I suppose that gives me the right to name it whatever I want.
</p>
<p>
    So, with that being said, let me introduce you to some of the other terms involved in this property.
</p>

<h3>Consolidation</h3>
<p>
    <i>Consolidation</i> is "rolling-up" individual bets into a single bet with the same win/loss characteristics.
    A typical consolidation is taking n number of $X bets into a single $Nx multi-number bet.
</p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>
    <i>Distribution</i> or <i>Decomposition</i> is taking a multi-number bet and breaking it down into smaller bets,
    often a series of "straight-up" single-number bets.
</p>
<p>
    It's also possible to decompose a multi-number bet into smaller multi-number bets. For example, a $10
    double-street bet can be broken down into two $5 street bets.
</p>
<h3>Density</h3>
<p>
    <i>Density</i> or <i>Betting Density</i> is the distributed value per spot once a consolidated bet has
    been fully distributed. You can also think of this as the <i>equity</i> per spot.
</p>
<p>
    In order for two betting scenarios to be equivalent, their betting density must be equal for the covered
    area. For example, you can bet $6 on the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" /> -
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    Double Street, but that would have a different density
    compared to betting $3 on the 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="1 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="2 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/4_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="4 Black" />,
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="5 Red" />
    Corner Bet in conjunction with a $3
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />, 
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />
    Split Bet. This implies that the two betting schemes are not equivalent and will pay out
    differently when the numbers hit.
</p>

<h2>How can I make use of the Distributive Property of Roulette Betting?</h2>
<p>
    I've been watching a lot of Roulette system reviews on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CEGDealerSchool">CEG Dealer School's YouTube Channel</a>, and I've
    noticed that the systems submittied by viewers are often impractical when it comes to betting at a
    brick and mortar casino.
</p>
<p>
    These systems may seem enjoyable on paper, but it's often extremely impractical to be betting on spots
    all over the table, since you may have to reach over other people. These systems also often require
    betting odd amounts if there's any Martingale-style "doubling-up" involved when you lose.
</p>
<p>
    But if you're able to roll-up bets and consolidate them using the Distributive Property of Roulette
    Betting (in reverse), you can often save time and prevent yourself from encroaching awkwardly into
    other people's personal space.
</p>
