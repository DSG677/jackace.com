<p>
    In addition to quizzing yourself using
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/05/Learn-Blackjack-in-your-Sleep/">Soundcloud</a> and
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/06/Blackjack-Video-Flashcards/">YouTube</a>, you
    can now test your Blackjack skills on the Amazon Echo!
</p>

<p>
    If you're not familiar with the
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B08J8FFJ8H/" target="_blank">Amazon Echo</a>
    (sometimes referred to as "Alexa"), it's a voice-activated speaker that acts a virtual
    assistant, making information easily available by just asking it questions.
</p>
<p>
    And the Echo has a bunch of third-party "skills" built by companies and independent developers
    that allow custom responses to certain phrases and questions.
</p>

<h2>The JackAce Flashcards Skill</h2>
<p>
    The JackAce Flashcards skill is an extension of my development of
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/05/Learn-Blackjack-in-your-Sleep/">audio</a> and
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/06/Blackjack-Video-Flashcards/">video</a>
    flashcards. With this skill however, you will have the added benefit of being able to answer
    the question and have the Echo correct you when you are wrong.
</p>
<p>
    To open the skill, just say,
</p>
<blockquote>
    Alexa, open "JackAce Flashcards"
</blockquote>

<h2>Skill modes</h2>
<h3>Review mode</h3>
<p>
    You can review all the 281 Blackjack decisions in this mode. Alexa will say the player hand and
    dealer's upcard. After a (very short) pause, she will reveal the correct action.
</p>
<h3>Test mode</h3>
<p>
    This is the mode you most likely want to use. Alexa will say the player hand and dealer upcard
    and will wait for you to answer. Correct actions are one of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Hit
        </li>
        <li>
            Stand
        </li>
        <li>
            Double Down
        </li>
        <li>
            Split
        </li>
        <li>
            Surrender if possible, otherwise Hit
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>What about other Table Conditions?</h2>
<p>
    Right now, the skill only supports Multiple Deck (4+) and Dealer Stands on Soft 17. In the future,
    we may add more rule variations.
</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>
    I slapped this skill together using
    <a href="https://blueprints.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon's "Blueprints" site</a>. It
    has a bunch of different Alexa skill templates that you can use off-the-shelf without any
    programming or deploying of services. Choose a template, fill out a form, and <i>BAM</i> -
    You've created a skill!

        There dozens of Alexa skill templates to choose from.

<p>
    But the downside to this simplicity is that the templates are <b>extremely</b> rigid. You can't
    supply a list of acceptable answers (e.g. "Double" in addition to "Double Down"), and there is a
    lot of weirdness when you get an answer wrong or ask Alexa to repeat herself.
</p>
<p>
    In the future, I may create a fully developed Alexa Skill, which keeps track of incorrect
    responses and re-quizzes you in problem areas to help commit the correct actions to memory, but
    for now, please enjoy JackAce Flashcards as is, warts and all!
