<p>
    I've been watching a lot of Roulette System videos by the CEG Dealer School and I find myself
    yelling a lot at the screen. Some of these systems waste your time by making a bunch of small
    bets when a large multi-number bet is possible. But worst of all, a lot of these systems end
    up covering more than 35 numbers at a time, which results in some of their bets being
    <b>wasted</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Other times, I've seen them pay bets out incorrectly because they're relying on the
    system's author's assesment of the payouts for each of the numbers (and because they're
    not following proper dealing procedure). The author just tells them "When you hit
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="3 Red" />
    through
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/6_b.svg" class="roulette-spot" alt="6 Black" />,
    you win $10" and they hand over $10 in chips to the bettor instead of sweeping the losing chips
    and paying the winning spots.
</p>

<h2>Introducing the Roulette Bet Analyzer</h2>
<p>
    I've built a tool that will help analyze your Roulette bets. This tool will do the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Displays a warning if you bet the 5-number "Top Line" bet
        </li>
        <li>
            Displays a warning if you bet on more than 35 numbers - resulting in
            <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2021/12/12/System-Review-Don't-Ever-Do-This-in-Roulette-867-5309/">"Bet Nullification"</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Displays the Win and Loss for each number
        </li>
        <li>
            Displays equity per number which can be used to roll-up bets into more convenient
            multi-number bets
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
