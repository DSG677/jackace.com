<p>
    Don't ever bet on more than 35 numbers at a time in Roulette! If you do, your bets will be working against
    each other to the point where some or even <i>all</i> of the bets will have <b>NO</b> chance of winning.
</p>

<h2>What is "Bet Nullification"?</h2>
<p>
    Some people <i>really</i> like to spread their bets around the Roulette table. They don't just make one or two
    bets covering a small section of the table, they go hogwild, taking up a ton of real estate on the felt.
    They're hedging their bets to increase their chances of getting paid, even though it results in a smaller
    overall payout.
</p>
<p>
    But if you end up spreading yourself <i>too</i> thin, you can put yourself in a situation where it becomes 
    <b>IMPOSSIBLE</b> to win. This is easy to see if you bet boths sides of an even money bet (When you bet on
    18 numbers at a time).
</p>
<p>
    For example, you could bet $100 on Red AND $100 on Black and \(36 \over 38\) (94.7%) of the time you'll end
    up with no gain and no loss. In this case, when the Roulette ball lands on any number between
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/36_r.svg" alt="36 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>, your $100 winning bet
    will cancel out your $100 losing bet.
</p>
<p>
    But when you hit the
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
    or the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>, you'll
    lose <b>ALL $200</b>!
</p>

        <figcaption>If you cover 36 numbers you might not have <b>ANY</b> way to win.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    This is a result of <i>Bet Nullification</i>.
</p>
<p>
    If you've never heard this term before, it's because I made it up. I named it this because you're making bets
    that render your other bets useless or "nullified".
    Whenever the win from one bet completely cancels
    out the losses of another bet (or set of bets), there is zero upside to making the bets at all.
</p> 
<p>
    And creating a Bet Nullification situation is a mathematical <i>certainty</i> once you hit the threshold of
    betting on 36 different numbers.
</p> 
<p>
    The Red/Black bet example is an <i>EXTREMELY</i> simple example of how you could make bets that nullify each
    other, but are there bet combinations that are more difficult to identify?
</p> 

<h2>Analying the "Diamond Heist" Roulette System</h2>
<p>
    I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo">CEG Dealer School's</a>
    YouTube channel recently and they were playing a system called "DIAMOND HEIST!" where they made the
    following bets:
</p> 
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-24/02-original-system-800x387.png" alt="Roulette Bets" />
    <figcaption>
        "ðŸ’Ž HEIST!" Roulette System <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZgHu0fdWTo&t=94s">tested
        and reviewed by CEG Dealer School</a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    It may not be instantly apparent, but they managed to spread $95 across all 36 Non-zero numbers.
</p> 
<p>
    And it's tough to see exactly <i>how much</i> of the $95 is being wasted, but it is <b>A LOT</b>. In fact,
    $45 of the $95 is cancelling itself out (47.3%!).
</p> 
<p>
    To identify the bet overlaps, we can apply the principals covered in my post on the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/11/Distributative-Bets-in-Roulette/">Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</a>.
    In that post, we learned:
</p> 
<blockquote>
    Betting $X on an n-number bet is equivalent to Betting \(\$X \over n\) on each of the covered numbers straight-up
</blockquote> 
<p>
    For example, betting $3 on the first Street
    (<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" alt="2 Black" class="roulette-spot"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" alt="3 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>) is the same as betting
    $1 each on the <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/2_b.svg" alt="2 Black" class="roulette-spot"/> and
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/3_r.svg" alt="3 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>.
</p> 

<p>
    Using this technique, we can break up all the multi-number bets into straight-up bets to see
    how much money is being bet on each number.
</p> 
<p>
    We could do the math and perform the division for each of the bets, or we can just enter the bets into
    the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/bet-analyzer/">Roulette Bet Analyzer</a> that I
    created and discuss in my
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/21/Roulette-Bet-Analyzer/">recent blog post</a>. This tool
    will do all the hard work for you.
</p> 
<p>
    Let's take a look at how our bets are distributed:
</p> 
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-24/04-og-equity-800x198.png" alt="There is $1.25 or more on every number" />
    <figcaption>
        Here we can see we've bet at least $1.25 on every number
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And let's look at the payouts:
</p> 
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-24/05-og-win-loss-800x198.png" alt="The Win/Loss results for every number" />
    <figcaption>
        These are the win/loss results for every number. Pay close attention to the
        <span class="amt-neg">$95</span> loss on
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
        and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>.        
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Once we spread the bets out like this, it's easy to see that we're betting $1.25 or more on <i>EVERY NUMBER</i>!
    This means that we can remove $1.25 per spot without impacting any of the payouts.
    Multiplying $1.25 by 36, we can see we're wasting $45 of the $95 being bet!
</p>
<p>
    So if we subtract $1.25 from every spot, our total amount bet will 
    be $50 and our bets will look like this:
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-24/06-improved-equity-800x198.png" alt="Roulette Bets (Improved system)" />
    <figcaption>
        Here we've subtracted $1.25 from every spot in the original system because the bets were "nullifying" each other.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And what do the payouts look like in our modified system?
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-01-24/07-improved-win-loss-800x198.png" alt="Roulette Bets (Improved system)" />
    <figcaption>
        Every payout is exactly the same in the 
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/1_r.svg" alt="1 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
        to <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/36_r.svg" alt="36 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>
        section of the layout, but you lose $45 less when you hit
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
        and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    So with this betting scheme, <i>EVERY SINGLE PAYOUT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM</i> - with the
    exception of the losses on <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/0_g.svg" alt="0 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>
    and <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/00_g.svg" alt="00 Green" class="roulette-spot"/>. When the Zeroes hit,
    you only lose <span class="amt-neg">$50</span> instead of the original <span class="amt-neg">$95</span>.
</p>
<p>
    So, your expected loss per spin in the improved system is only \(-5.26\% \times $50\) or
    <span class="amt-neg">-$2.63</span>, instead of \(-5.26\% \times $95\) or
    <span class="amt-neg">-$5.00</span> with the original system.
</p>
<p>
    And if you're looking at these bets and you're thinking that a casino won't let you bet these fractional amounts
    like $2.08 on
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/roulette/5_r.svg" alt="5 Red" class="roulette-spot"/>, 
    that's true. And it just so happens that we can rearrage all these bets and come up with the following bets that 
    a casino <i>will</i> allow.
</p>

        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/11/Distributative-Bets-in-Roulette/">Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</a>.
        allows you to roll up bets without impacting your
        wins or losses.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    And this makes sense if you understand what bets were removed. We've pulled $15 off the 3rd column and we've taken
    down $30 in 6 corner bets that makes up the first two columns. Those 6 bets could have been replicated by putting
    $15 on the 1st column and $15 on the 2nd column. This is possible by applying principals from my post on the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/2022/01/11/Distributative-Bets-in-Roulette/">Distributive Property of Roulette Betting</a>.
    After that, getting rid of the $45 of nullified bets becomes trivial.

<h2>Always Check your Systems!</h2>
<p>
    If you have a system you'd like analyzed or reviewed, make sure you check it to make sure you're not betting on
    more than 35 numbers at a time. You can run it through the
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gambling/roulette/bet-analyzer/">Roulette Bet Analyzer</a> to make sure.
</p> 
<p>
    So if you <i>ever</i> find yourself betting on 36 different numbers, you should know that you've triggered a
    Bet Nullification situation and that you should try to identify the nullified bets so that you can remove them
    from the table. You'll save yourself a lot of EV with zero downside!
