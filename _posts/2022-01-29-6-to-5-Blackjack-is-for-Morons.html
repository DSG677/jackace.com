    No, <i>"6-to-5 Blackjack"</i> isn't Blackjack that you play at 4:54pm. It is an atrocity and one of the worst
    things  to happen to Blackjack in the past few <b>decades</b>.
</p>

<h2>What is 6-to-5 Blackjack?</h2>
<p>
    Remember when corporate America took that thing you loved and changed it into some horrible ðŸ’© all in the name 
    greed? Maybe they took your sports team's iconic stadium and renamed it with their garbage name. Maybe they
    replaced  your favorite soda's sugar with high fructose corn syrup. Or maybe they rebooted your favorite
    childhood movie and cast Will Smith as a singing blue genie.

<p>
    Well, corporate America has done it again. They've ruined blackjack.
</p>
<p>
    A few years back, something called <i>"6-to-5 Blackjack"</i> started showing up around casinos in Las Vegas.
</p>
<p>
    It looks like Blackjack.<br/>
    It <i>feels</i> like Blackjack.<br/>
    It even <i>smells</i> like Blackjack.
</p>
<p>
    But there's a <b>HUGE</b> difference: 6-to-5 Blackjack <i>short-changes your Blackjack bonus by <b>60%</b></i>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="amt-bad">SIXTY PERCENT!</span>
</p>
<p>
    Let's say you make a $20 bet. When you get a Blackjack, you're supposed win $20 <b>plus an extra $10</b> for a
    total of $30. In 6-to-5 Blackjack, you only win $6 for every $5 you bet (hence <i>"6-to-5"</i>), so you win a
    total of $24. Subtract your original bet of $20 and your bonus is only $4!
</p>
<p>
    <b>Your $10 bonus has been reduced to $4</b>!

<h2>The House Edge of 6-to-5</h2>
<p>
    You can calculate the cost of playing 6-to-5 Blackjack pretty easily. To start, you need to know how frequently
    you can expect a starting hand of 21 and I <i>promise</i> it's easy to remember (You'll be quizzed on this
    later).
</p>
<p>
    On average, you will receive a Blackjack every 21 hands.
</p>
<p>
    So estimating the cost of this rule variant becomes pretty easy. Multiply the probability of having a
    Blackjack (\(1 \over 21\)) by the probability of the dealer <i>not</i> having a Blackjack
    (\(1 - {1 \over 21}\) or \(20 \over 21\)) and the change in your payout, which is 0.3
    of your initial bet (60% of your half-bet bonus) and you get:
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    {1 \over 21} \times {20 \over 21} \times -0.3 & \approx -0.0136054 \\
    & \approx \color{red}{-1.36054\%}
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    That's a very good approximation for the cost of this rule variant! When you look at the actual cost of the
    rule, it comes <i>very</i> close:

<h2>6-to-5 versus other Table Conditions and Rule Variants</h2>
<p>
    How does this rule change compare to other table conditions?
</p>
<p>
    After the 6-to-5 payout change, the next biggest change would be moving from Single Deck Blackjack
    to 8 deck Blackjack. Increasing the number of decks from 1 to 8 increases the house edge by 0.48%.
    This is barely <b>A THIRD</b> of the penalty for 6-to-5!
</p>
<p>
    Besides changing the number of decks in play, casinos can add to their edge by Hitting a Soft 17
    instead of Standing. This change will only cost the player 0.2125% in house advantage. This makes
    the 6-to-5 rule more than <b>6 TIMES WORSE</b> than the next highest rule change [[EXPLAIN DIFFERENCE 
    BETWEEN TABLE CONDITIONS AND RULE CHANGES]].

<h2>We could all use a little Chaaaaaaaange!</h2>
<p>
    One aspect of 6-to-5 Blackjack that I almost <i>never</i> hear discussed is that you end up with a
    <i>lot</i> of odd chips that you wouldn't normally have in front of you.
</p>
<p>
    For almost <i>ALL</i> betting units, getting paid 6-to-5 on a Blackjack will
    leave you with chips you don't really want to deal with.

    It's true that some bet sizes will also get mismatched chips with Standard 3-to-2 Blackjack, but this
    only with specific betting units ($25 bet is a prime example), and this is greatly mitigated because
    it only takes one <i>extra</i> blackjack to make that half-bet whole and then you can use it for your
    next bet. So on average in Standard Blackjack, you will be sitting with those odd chips for 21 hands 
    (Pop-Quiz: Do you remember why?).
</p>
<p>
    If you're playing 6-to-5 Blackjack and sitting there with 20% of your unit bet in odd chips, you would
    expect to wait for another <b>4 Blackjacks</b> before your odd-chip stack grows to a full-sized bet. On
    average, you'll need to wait <b>84 HANDS</b> (4 x one Blackjack every 21 hands), and the entire time you're
    waiting, your stack of odd chips will just continue to get awkwardly larger.
</p>

    <figcaption>Odd chip denominations may end up in the dealer tip box</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Why do I bother bringing this up? Is it because I'm a neat freak who only wants a single chip denomination
    in front of me? No. It's no bother at all except when I have a dealer with an attitude. If you're
    winning, some dealers can be quick to remind you that they depend on tips for a living.
</p>
<p>
    So in <i>addition</i> to getting short-changed on your payouts, now you've got a crabby dealer mad-dogging
    you as your odd-chip Blackjack scoreboard grows larger and larger. Even though I strongly encourage you to
    tip dealers when you're doing well, if you tip while playing 6-to-5 Blackjack, you are giving up what
    little chance you have of coming out ahead.
</p>

<h2>Why do People Play 6-to-5 Blackjack?</h2>
<p>
    Because, like you, these people are <i>Donkeys</i>. But you're reading this post, so at least you're trying to
    be a smarter gambler!
</p>
<p>
    There are four main reasons why people play this horrible game:
</p>
<h3>It's often offered with Single Deck</h3>
<p>
    The 6-to-5 payout is often combined with the offering of Single Deck Blackjack, which is usually characterized as
    being more "Player Friendly". This is the carrot casinos offer before beating you with their stick.
</p>
<p>
    As we have already discussed, the 6-to-5 payout penalty dwarfs the benefit of switching from 6 Deck to Single Deck. 
    Also, when you combine the two rule changes, the 6-to-5 has an even <i>HIGHER</i> penalty. This is because most of 
    the benefit from lowering the number of decks is from the increase in blackjack frequency. With the lower 6-to-5
    payout, the benefits of single-deck are Nerfed.
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    EV_{single deck} + EV_{6 to 5} & < EV_{singledeck + 6 to 5} \\
    0.45742 + -1.36504 & < -0.93736 \\
    -0.90762 & < \color{red}{-0.93736} \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    As you can see, the change in negative Expected Value (EV) is <i>greater than</i> the sum of the two conditions\
    applied independently.
</p>
<h3>It's Your Only Choice at Lower Limit Tables</h3>
<p>
    I've heard people say that 6-to-5 is good because it offers a way for casinos to offer Blackjack to players 
    who can't afford the higher limit <i>Real</i> Blackjack tables.
</p>
<p>
    I strongly disagree. You wouldn't try to make flying more affordable by using planes with no stabilization
    system. The experience would be completely uncomfortable and people flying for the first time will likely
    <i>never</i> fly again. If you can't afford to fly on a safe plane, then take Amtrak or a Greyhound Bus.
</p>
<p>
    Novice players already make tons of mistakes. Combine that with the 6-to-5 tax, these
    players will be even <i>more</i> likely to lose. These losing players will never graduate into a
    high-rolling Blackjack player.
</p>
<p>
    New players will be destined to lose and the generational gap will continue to widen, which will drive
    revenue down even further.
</p>

<h3>People Don't Understand Fractions</h3>
<p>
    Some people see the 6 and the 5 and just associate it with a higher value than the normal 3-to-2 payout.
    You'd think that people would have better math skills than that, but remember when a fast-food chain tried
    marketing their 1/3 pound burger and
    <a href="https://www.adweek.com/agencies/aws-1-3rd-pound-burger-failed-so-its-trying-a-3-9th-pound-burger-instead/" target="_blank">it failed because people thought it was smaller than McDonald's 1/4 pounder</a>?
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Well of course the Quarter Pounder's bigger! The Quarter Pounder's got a 4 in it and the Third Pounder's only got a measley 3!"
    <footer>
        - those people, probably.
    </footer>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Well that restaurant's marketing department seems to have learned from their mistakes and have actually
    rebranded the burger as a <i>3/9th Pounder</i>!
</p>

        The A&amp;W 1/3 Burger failed because customers reportedly believed it was smaller than McDonald's 1/4 pounder <i>(weight before cooking)</i>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    As silly as this might seem, this is a legitimate concern that affects a fair amount of the population.
</p>

<h3>Ain't Nobody Got Time Fo' Dat</h3>
<p>
    The biggest reason people end up playing these tables is both ignorance and indifference. Unfortunately for
    you donkeys, gambling is becoming less and less of an attraction for tourists. Casinos now 
    need to provide ultra-fine dining, A-List DJs in their Night Clubs, and well as A-List resident entertainers
    in their theater.
</p>

    <figcaption>A-List resident artists are high in demand and cost a pretty penny (when they actually show up)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    For these new-school Vegas tourists, gambling is just background noise. They don't know much about 
    any of the games casinos offer. They've never even seen a Blackjack Basic Strategy card. For the new
    generation of Vegas tourists, even taking the time to calculate whether 6-to-5 pays more Standard Blackjack
    isn't worth the mental effort.
</p>

<h2>Stand up to Corporate Greed!</h2>
<p>
    6-to-5 Blackjack isn't real Blackjack. My hope (and yes, it is a <i>long shot</i>) is that educating
    Donkeys like you will eventually turn the tide on this rule variant as well as the deluge of changes
    soon to follow.
</p>
<p>
    In the grand scheme of things, 6-to-5 Blackjack is far from the worst game that casinos offer.
    Double-Zero Roulette is far worse with the house edge of 5.26%. Single-deck 6:5 only has a house edge
    of about 1.7%.
</p>
<p>
    So why does 6-to-5 Blackjack piss me off so much? Because Blackjack was a game that people could play
    at <i>any</i> betting level and be almost even with the house <i>if they took the time to study
    how to play</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Gamblers were rewarded for memorizng the 281 Basic Strategy decisions
    (which is now possible to <a href="/blog/2021/12/05/Learn-Blackjack-in-your-Sleep/">learn in your
    sleep!</a>). If someone wanted to be lazy and accept poor odds, they could just play Roulette. If
    someone wanted better odds but had a lot of money, they could play Baccarat. But now low limit
    players have really nowhere to turn for an option with a low house edge.

    But worst of all, they're just giving you a shitty experience and not giving you anything in return.
    I can picture the casino executives in their penthouse corner office twirling their sinister waxed
    handlebar moustaches while cackling and high-fiving themselves about this. They implemented this
    and consumers didn't have any indication of slowing down.

    I hate using the term "Slippery Slope", but it is more than appropriate here. There isn't a hypothetical
    slope that is coming down the road in 5 to 10 years. This is a garbage chute greased with butter
    and we're all being actively shoved down it. Every time consumers accept crap like this, corporations
    come back with more ways to screw us. We're already starting to see this with wretched changes like
    <b>Triple-Zero Roulette</b> (7.7% house edge), casino garage parking fees, and don't even get me
    started on the senseless <b>Resort Fees</b> when booking a hotel.

    So don't play 6-to-5 Blackjack.<br/>
    Don't let your friends play 6-to-5 Blackjack.<br/>
    Don't let your friends' friends play 6-to-5 Blackjack.<br/>

    If you can help stop this insanity, maybe together we can prevent the birth of
    <b>"Quadruple Zero Roulette"</b>, <b>"Ties-Count-as-a-Loss Baccarat"</b>, and
    <b>"11-to-10 Blackjack"</b>.
