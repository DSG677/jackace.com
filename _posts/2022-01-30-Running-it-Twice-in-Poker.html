<p>
    Around the year 2006, an option for "Running it Twice" started to become popular on televised
    Poker cash games. It became a pretty popular on the show <i>High Stakes Poker</i> on GSN and
    several other cash game shows.
</p>
<p>
    But what affect does running it once, twice, or even 44 times do to your expected result? How does it
    affect your variance?
</p>

<h2>What is "Running it Twice"?</h2>
<p>
    Two players can agree to "run it twice" when one of the players is all-in and there are
    still more cards to come. When the players agree to "run it twice", they are agreeing to complete
    the hand with two sets of outcomes. If there is one card left to be dealt, then two cards will be
    dealt, each card acting as a the final community card for two separate outcomes. The winner of each
    outcome will be entited to a half of the total pot.
</p>
<p>
    If you win both times, you win the entire pot. If you lose both times, you lose the entire pot.
    If you win one and lose the other, then the pot is divided in half and distributed to the two
    players. 
</p>

<h3>What about Running it 3 or 4 or even 44 Times?</h3>
<p>
    You can "run it" multiple times. Each time you run it, the pot shares become smaller and 
    smaller, and it becomes more likely that the underdog will get at least <i>some</i> of his money
    back.
</p>
        
<h2>Why can't you Run it Twice in a Tournament?</h2>
<p>
    The option to run it multiple times usually only applies to cash games. You probably won't
    have this option available in a tournament for two big reasons.
</p>
<h3>It's disruptive</h3>
<p>
    Deciding how many times to run it takes time.<br/>
    Dealing extra turns and extra rivers takes time.<br/>
    Splitting the pot and even figuring out who won each pot takes time<br/>
</p>
<p>
    And time is often your enemy when blind levels increase every couple of minutes.
</p>

<h3>It opens the door for collusion</h3>
<p>
    If two players are soft-playing each other because they are friends or if they both
    have a financial interest in the other winning (i.e. if they are partially staking
    each other), then it's in their best interest to keep each other in the tournament
    by winning a split pot as opposed to being eliminated.
</p>
<p>
    Even though it's possible to collude without running it twice, keeping your friends
    afloat becomes pretty easy when you give him multiple opportunities to spike his
    one-outer.
</p>
<p>
    Worst of all, there's no reason why anyone in the tournament would want a player
    to avoid possible elimination. The only person who benefits from winning part of
    a split pot would be the player who is all-in.
</p>

<h2>How does Running it Multiple Times affect Your EV?</h2>
<p>
    It doesn't.
</p>
<p>
    Your Expected Value will be exactly the same as if you just ran it once, twice, or
    even 44 times.
</p>

<h2>How does Running it Multiple Times affect Your Variance?</h2>
<p>
    The only statistical change that results from multiple run-outs is a lowering of
    variance. The more turns and rivers you see, the more your results will resemble
    the expected result and the lower the fluctuation to your bankroll.
</p>

<h2>Calculating the Results of Running it N Times</h2>
<p>
    I think most seasoned poker players are already aware that running it multiple times
    results in <i>zero</i> change to your EV. But I've often heard noobs (incorrectly)
    say that running it multiple times is bad for the favorite in the situation.
</p>

<h3>1-outer on the River</h3>
<p>
    Let's take a look at an extreme situation.
</p>
<p>
    I think the best way to illustrate that the EV remains the same is to look at the case
    where the underdog has a one-outer with just the River to come.
</p>
<p>
    Favorite:
    {%- include card.html card="Ah" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="Kh" -%}
</p>
<p>
    Underdog:
    {%- include card.html card="3h" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="2h" -%}
</p>
<p>
    Board:
    {%- include card.html card="4h" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="5h" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="9c" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="Js" -%}
</p>
<p>
    Here, the Favorite has the nut-flush and the Underdog is drawing to a 
    {%- include card.html card="6h" -%}.
</p>
<p>
    There are 44 unknown cards and only 1 card will make the underdog a winner.
    If the post were $44, then he'd have an EV of $1.
</p>
<p>
    So let's run it 44 times!
</p>
<p>
    To do this, we have to ignore burn cards and deal out all 44 River cards and
    make forty-four $1 pots.
</p>
<p>
    Since we already know the dog is drawing to a one-outer, we know exactly one
    of those $1 pots will have his 
    {%- include card.html card="6h" -%}, netting him $1 and awarding the favorite
    $43.
</p>

<h3>What about Multiple Outs?</h3>
<p>
    And the same is true for any number of outs with just the River to come. If
    the dog is drawing to a flush against the favorite's top pair, we'd be looking
    at 9 outs.
</p>
<p>
    Favorite:
    {%- include card.html card="As" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="Kc" -%}
</p>
<p>
    Underdog:
    {%- include card.html card="Jh" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="8h" -%}
</p>
<p>
    Board:
    {%- include card.html card="4h" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="5h" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="Ac" -%}
    {%- include card.html card="Ts" -%}
</p>
<p>
    In our $44 pot situation, his EV would be $9, and if we ran it 44 times,
    he'd get back exactly that.
</p>
