        If you have more than $10k in crypto, you should have a hardware wallet...or two.

    If all of your crypto holdings are on an exchange, do you really own it?
</p>

<p>
    If that exchange gets shut down or if an employee decides to walk away with
    the company's holdings, how would you get your money back?
</p>
<p>
    The short answer is <i>you won't</i>.
</p>
<p>
    There is little to no protection for a crypto investor with millions on a crypto
    exchange. The FDIC won't protect you from large losses if the exchange goes under or if
    they just decide they don't want to honor your deposit.
</p>
<p>
    If you have more than $10,000 worth of crypto, a small $150 investment in a hardware
    wallet can prevent such a disaster and can offer you peace of mind.

<h2>The History of Entrusting Crypto to Others</h2>

        70,000 BTC was stolen from customers of MtGox. This is worth almost $3 Billion today.

    We're still in the early days of crypto. The term "Wild Wild West" is an extremely appropriate 
    description of the current crypto era.
</p>
<p>
    For <i>ANY</i> cyrpto company that might hold your coins, you are going to be subject
    to four major risks.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Lack of legal expertise
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of operational expertise
    </li>
    <li>
        Shitty security practices
    </li>
    <li>
        Intentional fraud (Ponzi schemes, Rug pulls, etc.)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If a businessman today decides he wants to build a company that centers around crypto, he is
    almost certainly a <i>severe</i> risk-taker. This is an <i>EXTREMELY</i> fast-moving sector
    where things like folliwng laws and ensuring security often fall by the wayside.
</p>
<p>
    It's difficult to find anyone with more than a few months of experience with laws and security
    in the cyrpto space, so making sure your corportation is protected from both a legal and
    cybersecurity standpoint is extremely difficult.
</p>
<p>
    And technology companies are expected to deliver new features at a breakneck rate.
</p>
<p>
    This means that any crypto company that you might entrust with your coins is going to be subject to

</p>

<h2>What is a Hardware Wallet?</h2>
<p>
    When you hear the term "wallet", you usually think of an object that holds valuables inside.
    It's true that a hardware wallet protects valuables, but it's not the cryptocurrencies themselves.
    A crypto wallet doesn't hold crypto. The valuable thing you're holding is the "keys".
</p>
<p>
    I'll say it again:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <b>A crypto wallet doesn't hold crypto.</b>
</blockquote>

<h2>Picking a Hardware Wallet</h2>

        Trezor and Ledger are the two biggest players in the Hardware Wallet space.
    </figcaption>

<p>
    There are two major cryptocurrency hardware wallet maufacturers: Trezor and Ledger. If you buy either of
    their top two products, you'll be fine. The biggest difference between the two is that the Ledger can handle
    more coins.

    I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the above choices. Your biggest concerns should
    be cost and support for your desired coins. I think the Trezor is easier to use, but it is more
    expensive. I also like that Trezor has different color wallets. This is helpful if you have multiple
    wallets (which I <i>strongly</i> suggest you get).

    Also, Ledger had an issue with their customer data being stolen and used in numerous phishing attacks.
    I was a victim of these attacks. Luckily, I created a new email address before ordering from Ledger, so
    they can no longer
