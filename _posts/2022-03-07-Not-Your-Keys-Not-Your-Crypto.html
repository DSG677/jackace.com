<p>
    If all of your crypto is on an exchange, do you really own it?
</p>

<p>
    If that exchange gets shut down or if an employee decides to walk away with
    the company's coffer, how would you get your money back?
</p>
<p>
    The short answer is <i>you won't</i>.
</p>
<p>
    There is little to no protection for a crypto investor with their assets in a crypto
    exchange. The FDIC won't protect you from large losses if the exchange goes under or if
    they just decide they don't like you and they don't want to honor your deposit.
</p>

<h2>Why is your crypto in danger?</h2>
<p>
    There are 3 major factors that put your coin in peril.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mismanagement
    </li>
    <li>
        Malice
    </li>
    <li>
        Misconduct
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Mismanagement</h2>
<p>
    If you need a great attorney, you have thousands to choose from. If you need a
    great accountant, there are over a million.
</p>
<p>
    And both of these professions have well established certification processes to ensure they know
    what they are doing. You can make sure your accountant is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and
    you can make sure your attorney is a memeber of the state bar association.
</p>
<p>
    There really is no recognized certification process for cryptocurrencies. And even the
    <i>"experts"</i> would only have a few years' worth of experience working with it.
</p>
<p>
    And to top this all off -- nearly <i>EVERYONE</i> involved in crypto is quite comfortable
    taking on a <b>TON</b> of risk if the rewards involve stratospheric success. This is
    <i>on top</i> of the risk-taking already associated with technology start-ups.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked with many non-crypto start-ups that sacrifice legal compliance and strong
    security for the ability to
    <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-mark-zuckerberg-new-values-move-fast-and-break-things-2022-2" target="_target">"move fast and break things"</a>
    as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg so famously put it. Crypto companies take this to a
    <b>COMPLETELY</b> different level.
</p>

<blockquote>
    Crypto is a new industry.<br/>
    Very few people have more than 1 or 2 years' of experience with it.<br/>
    Almost nobody in crypto learned about it in school.<br/>
    There are no certifications for proving someone is an expert in the field.<br/>
    Being <b>purely</b> digitadl makes crypto extremely easy to steal.<br/>
</blockquote>

<h3>MtGox.com</h3>
<h4>Lost 740,000 BTC</h4>
<p>
    In June 2011, the largest Bitcoin exchange was being run from a site originally created to trade
    cards for the game
    <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/" target="_blank">"Magic: The Gathering"</a> (MTGOX originally
    stood for "<b>M</b>agic: <b>T</b>he <b>G</b>athering <b>O</b>nline e<b>X</b>change").
</p>
<p>
    There were a series of breaches during that month, including the loss of over 25,000 Bitcoin (then
    worth around $400k), the posting of their entire customer base to a public site, and the transfer of
    a "large number" of Bitcoins from a Hacker who compromised an auditor's computer.
</p>
<p>
    Then again in 2014, MtGox announced that they had lost over <span class="amt-bad">740,000+ Bitcoin</span>
    (then only worth $400M, and in 2022 worth almost $30 Billion). Their customers were never made
    whole and basically walked away with nothing.
</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>
        70,000 BTC was stolen from customers of MtGox. This is worth almost $3 Billion today in 2022.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Bitfinex</h3>
<h4>Lost 120,000 BTC</h4>
<p>
    In 2016, almost 120,000 BTC (then worth around $60M USD and now worth more than $4 BILLION) was
    <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/08/us-officials-seize-bitcoin-from-2016-bitfinex-hack/" target="_blank">stolen from Crypto Exchange site Bitfinex</a>.
    At the time, this represented about 30% of customers' holdings, and all customers were forced to
    take the brunt of the loss.
</p>
<p>
    Customers were "compensated" by being issued <b>BFX</b> tokens at a rate of $1 for every dollar
    lost (30% of each customer's holdings). So if you had $100 of Bitcoin at the time of the breach,
    you were issued 30 BFX tokens. Within a few months all of those tokens were exchanged for
    iFinex stock.
</p>
<p>
    If customers were able to hold on to their BTC, they would have seen it appreciate from $600 at
    the time of the theft to today's price of over $40,000. Instead, they were issued a fraction of
    their worth in the stock of a shitty company.

<h3>StakeHound and Fireblocks</h3>
<h4>Lost 38,178 ETH</h4>
<p>
    StakeHound promised people that you could "stake" Ethereum with them and earn rewards
    as they used that Ethereum to create "Validators" to support Ethereum's migration to
    Proof of Stake.
</p>
<p>
    StakeHound left a third-party company named Fireblocks handle the custody of that ETH,
    and in June 2021, Fireblocks reportedly lost the private keys to 38,178 ETH (currently
    worth $110+ Million USD) and did not have a backup.
</p>
<p>
    Not having access to the private keys means that the ETH is unrecoverable. It is unclear
    whether customers will be compensated for the loss.

<h2>Mailice</h2>

<h3>Turkish Crypto Exchange Thodex</h3>
<h4>CEO stole over $2 Billion USD</h4>
<p>
    In April 2021, Faruk Fatih Ozer, CEO of the Turkish Crypto Exchange Thodex, reportedly fled to
    Albania with over <span class="amt-bad">$2 Billion</span> worth of customers' assets. He is
    currently on the lam, leaving Thodex's 400,000 customers high and dry.

<h3>Wixiplay Casino</h3>
<h4>Online Casino doesn't honor Crypto withdrawals</h4>
<p>
    There are several online casinos out there that offer Cryptocurrencies as a method of making
    deposits. This is one way that they are able to get around US laws like the UIGEA, which
    prevent a US-based bank from making a deposit to an online gambling site.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-03-05/05-wixiplay-592x558.png" alt="Online Casino Wixiplay" />
    <figcaption>
        Michael "Wizard of Odds" Shackleford claims that Online Casino was using an unfair
        algorithm in addition to not honoring Bitcoin withdrawals.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    But that's not the <i>only</i> way that Wixiplay Casino skirts the rules. They have a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OXjKcheAug" target="_blank">provably unfair</a>
    dice game, and to make matters worse, they have been known to not honor withdrawal
    requests.
</p>
<p>
    Not every online casino that accepts crypto is malicious, but you really have to be cautious
    if you're going to gamble online.
</p>

<h2>Misconduct</h2>
<p>
    When I say <i>"misconduct"</i>, I'm actually speaking about <i>your</i> misconduct. And when I
    say <i>"your misconduct"</i>, I actually mean someone else's <i>perception</i> of your
    misconduct, whether it be real or misconstrued.
</p>
<!--
<p>
    Let's say you bought some crypto from an exchange called "Strictly Orthodox Ultra Religious Crypto
    Exchange" (SOURCE), who rewards followers of their faith with extremely low trading fees.
    Great deal, right?
</p>
<p>
    After being a customer of theirs for years, you decide to give the gift of crypto to your nephew
    Johnny for Christmas...directly from your SOURCE wallet. Then a few weeks later, Johnny buys weed
    and pays a famous Web Cam Girl using that crypto with the destination wallet addresses being
    well-known. 
</p>
<p>
    SOURCE believes that you spent your crypto on vices against the tenants of your religion and
    freezes your account. Even if there is no legal basis for doing this, you're still not going
    to be able to access your funds without a long legal fight.
</p>
-->
<p>
    You may think this sounds like fiction, but people are currently clamoring for 
    crypto sites to freeze the accounts of <i>ANY</i> Russian national in response
    for Russia's current war with Ukraine. We've already had 
</p>

<h3>Silk Road</h3>
<h4>144,000+ Bitcoin Seized</h4>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-03-05/06-silk-road-800x707.png" alt="The founder of Dark Web site Silk Road was arrested and all 144,000 BTC was seized." />
    <figcaption>
        Dark Web site the Silk Road was shut down and over 144,000 BTC was seized. None was
        given back to customers, who mainly used the site for illegal activities.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    In 2013, the one of the largest Crypto sites was being run by a 29 year-old named
    Ross "Dread Pirate Roberts" Ulbrecht. He ran the <i>Dark Web</i> site "Silk Road", and was
    worth over $80 million.
</p>
<p>
    He oversaw over $1 BILLION in transactions through his site, which facilitated the sale of
    illegal drugs, fake IDs, and more illicit items. He got caught after
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/five-stupid-things-dread-pirate-roberts-did-to-get-arrested">bragging on LinkedIn</a>
    about how he ran a multi-million dollar drug marketplace.
</p>
<p>
    When the site was shut down in 2013, the FBI seized <span class="amt-bad">144,000+ Bitcoin</span>,
    including 26,000 of their customers' balances. That cache of Bitcoin was never returned to Silk
    Road customers, and because of the nature of the illegal purchases they were involved in, I doubt
    many of those people are going to come forward to stake their claim to their lost coin.
</p>

<h2>Take your Crypto off the Sites</h2>
<p>
    When you don't have complete control over your crypto, it's subject to being taken
    from you, and there are many reasons to believe it <i>will</i> be taken.
</p>
<!--
<p>
    I understood the value a decentralized currency when I realized that it is basically Venmo
    without an overlord who can subjectively and sometimes arbitrarily deny your transactions.
</p>
-->
<p>
    I've had money taken away from me by PayPal because an eBay customer fraudulently lied to
    them about a sale that I made and delivered as described.
</p>
<p>
    I know people who have had their Venmo accounts locked because the transaction comments
    mentioned the word "poker".
</p>
<p>
    I've had my NETELLER account frozen because I moved to a different country and they
    thought I was trying to commit fraud.
</p>
<p>
    If you entrust a large part of your life savings to a company that isn't safeguarded by
    established practices and regulatory protections, you shouldn't be surprised if you lose
    access to it all.
</p>
<p>
    So to prevent yourself being locked out of your funds due to their crappy management, their
    interpretation of your actions, or straight up thievery, you need to move your crypto
    off of exchanges and lending sites like BlockFi and Celcius.
</p>
<p>
    The best place to keep your crypto is a wallet. A hardware wallet made by a well-known and
    trustworthy manufacturer like <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="_blank">Trezor</a>
    or <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">Ledger</a>. We'll show you how
    to setup your hardware wallet and keep it secure in the next few weeks.
