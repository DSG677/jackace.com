    Yes, it's possible to win money from an online casino. You just need to know where to look.
</p>

<p>
    In 2005, my brother noticed some odd behavior while playing Blackjack on the gambling
    site ParadisePoker.com. They had just released a new version of their software that allowed
    players to play blackjack in addition to their poker offerings, so the new game was just
    exposed to the public for a few days.
</p>

<h2>The Bug</h2>
<p>
    My brother informed me that whenever the dealer had an Ace as their upcard, there would be a
    slight delay when they asked you for insurance <i>AND</i> they had a 10 as their hole card.
</p>
<p>
    This was a <b>HUGE</b> boon to the player!
</p>
<p>
    If this were true, that means that you could make a <i>perfect</i> insurance bet every time and
    basically turn a loss into a push whenever the dealer had a starting hand of 21 (with an Ace upcard).
    This would save you one full bet every 42 hands or so.
</p>
<p>
    The insurance bet is usually a really bad offering for the player, with a house advantage
    ranging from 7.7% (infinite deck) to as high as 14.3% (single-deck holding two 10s versus a
    n dealer Ace).
</p>

    <figcaption>
        You can make an Insurance bet when the dealer has an Ace showing. If they have a 10 in the
        hole, you win your Insurance bet, which pays 2:1. This is usually a losing proposition.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    I couldn't believe that something like this could be released to the public unnoticed by their
    testers, so I opened up their program and played a few rounds to see for myself.
</p>
<p>
    After winning several Insurance bets, I was able to confirm that my brother was correct!
</p>

<h2>The Edge</h2>
<p>
    The normal overall house advantage for Blackjack is about 0.5%. The bug allowed you to tip the
    edge in the player's favor by much more than that!
</p>
<p>
    There was one case where the bug didn't telegraph the hole card. If the player had a blackjack
    and the dealer had an Ace up, the unnatural pause would be present, regardless of what the
    dealer's hole card was.
</p>
<p>
    So to estimate the change in Expected Value (EV) due to this bug, you can use the following formula:
</p>
<p class="p-center">
    \begin{align}
    \Delta_{EV} & \approx P_{Dealer\,Ace\,upcard} \times P_{Dealer\,10\,holecard} \times (1 - P_{Player\,blackjack}) \times Win \, amount\\
    \\
    & \approx \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{4}{13} \times (1 - \frac{8}{169}) \times 1 \, unit \\
    \\
    & \approx 2.255\% \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    This turns a game with a 0.5% house advantage into a game with a 1.755% <i>PLAYER ADVANTAGE</i>!
</p>
<p>
    This is absurdly high, considering that highly skilled card counters usually typically only have a
    1.5% to 2% advantage over the house!
</p>

<h2>The Win</h2>
<p>
    I initially had a few hundred dollars in this account, and I actually lost it all before I was
    able to get any traction. Even with a 1.8% house advantage, you can easily lose money due to variance, 
    especially with such a small amount relative to your bet size (I was betting around $25 per hand).
</p>
<p>
    To supplement my funds, I initiated a $1000 deposit, which took another
    day to process before I was able to use the funds.
</p>
<p>
    After the funds were cleared I was able to comfortably bet $25 per hand until my bankroll doubled to
    $2000. It doubled again to $4000 and I eventually got to the point where I was betting the table max
    of $300 per hand and steadily winning.
</p>
<p>
    I stayed up all night playing until I couldn't keep my eyes open. I was almost up $10,000 and I decided
    to call it a night and went to bed. In addition to not being able to stay awake, I didn't want to cross
    any significant thresholds that might set off alarm bells with Paradise Poker's team. I also wasn't sure
    whether online casinos were required to issue Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) for wins over $10,000
    (brick and mortar casinos will issue these on large cash winnings), so I stayed shy of winning that amount.
</p>
<p>
    The bug was already "in the wild" for over a week and there was no reason to believe it wouldn't be
    exploitable for many more days. I didn't want to tap the glass to alert the 
</p>
<p>
    The next day before I could start playing, my brother informed me that the bug had been fixed. Logging in,
    I quickly verified that he was right. The gravy train had come to its final destination.
</p>

<h2>The End of the Line</h2>
<p>
    I quickly made a withdrawal request for half of my winnings. The next day, I requested the other half.
    I didn't want to be accused of cheating or any other punishible acts, so I wanted to make sure I was
    able to get my money off the site before they could accuse me of any wrongdoing.
</p>

<!-- <p>
    I couldn't believe it because I took screenshots of
    the server and client versions of the software and they were still the same.
</p> -->

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>
    I eventually wrote about this exploit and the story was published by
    <a href="https://store.2600.com/collections/2000-2009/products/summer-2005" target="_blank">2600: The Hacker Quarterly</a>
    in their Summer 2005 issue. The article was also re-published in their hardcover book
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-2600-Hacker-Odyssey/dp/0470294191/" target="_blank">The Best of 2600: A Hacker Odyssey</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This blog post is more detailed than that original article, where a lot of details were cut out in the
    interest of brevity.
</p>
<p>
    Later in my career, I happened to work with Paradise Poker's former head of payments, security and fraud,
    who worked there at the time of the exploit. He told me they were well aware of
    the exploit as it was happening. They were considering pulling the plug on the game while
    they re-tooled it, but the <b>amazing</b> thing was <i>they were still making money on the
    game</i>! There were a few whale players who were down 6 figures, so they decided to keep the feature
    up, bugs and all while they fixed it.
</p>
<p>
    Even with a handful of guys like me and my brother exploiting this flaw, the amount of money
    being lost by losing players was eclipsing the 2% house edge the keen-eyed players were
    enjoying.
