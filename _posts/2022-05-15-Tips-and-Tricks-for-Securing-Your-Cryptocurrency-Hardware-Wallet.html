    What's the best way of keeping your cryptocurrency wallet secure? There are three major steps
    that you should be taking in keeping your crypto safe.

    </ol>
</p>

<h2>Create and SECURE a 24-Word Seed Phrase</h2>
<p>
    The first step in securing your hardware wallet is to create a secure seed phrase. Even though
    shorter phrases are available, use the 24 word option, which is (obviously) the most
    secure.
</p>
<p>
    Seed phrases used with hardware wallets are based on the BIP-39 specificiation, so they are
    meant to be interchangable amongst compatible hardware wallets.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        You should use a 24-Word Seed Phrase. This is preferable over the shorter and less-secure
        12 and 18 word phrases.

<h3>How to Secure your Seed Phrase</h3>
<p>
    <b>NEVER</b> store your Seed Phrase electronically in <b>ANY FORM</b>. This means you need to
    write it down on paper, or better yet, you should scribe it on metal. This copy of your Seed
    Phrase should be stored in a home safe or a safety deposit box.
</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    This <i>also</i> means that you should not take a picture of it! Digital photos often end up
    on a Cloud server (either purposely or accidentally), where they can be scanned with OCR
    software and easily checked for words on the seed phrase list.
</p>
<p>
    You should avoid recording your Seed Phrase in any of the following formats:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Any digital text file or word processing file
        </li>
        <li>
            In a Password Manager like LastPass or 1Password
        </li>
        <li>
            A photo of any format - digital or even print
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    Any person who has access to your Seed Phrase can recreate your wallet
    <i>without requiring physical access to your hardware wallet AND without knowing your PIN</i>.
    They can access all the crypto in your (main) wallet. This is why protecting your
    Seed Phrase is the most important step in securing your hardware wallet.
</p>
<p>
    Phishing scams that get crypto holders to volunteer their seed phrase are amongst the
    most common of crypto scams and have resulted in the forfeiture of millions of dollars
    worth of crypto. You need to ensure you keep your seed phrase 100% offline.
</p>

<h2>Add a "25th" Word to your Seed Phrase</h2>
<p>
    The major hardware wallets all support a "25th" word. This can be used to create a "hidden"
    wallet (or multiple hidden wallets, if you desire).
</p>
<p>
    The 25th word protects your crypto from falling into the wrong hands if someone gets a hold
    of your Seed Phrase list. If you were to keep that list in a safe deposit box, any banker
    with the authority to force open boxes (which can happen when you lose the key or if law
    enforcement tells them to).
</p>

<div class="infobox-info">
    <p>
        If there is a "reasonable" suspicion that illegal items may be in a safe deposit box,
        law enforcement officials can obtain a court order to freeze the owner's access to
        it. In criminal cases investigators can force the box open and seize its contents.
        They don't even need to seize the contents - they might just snap a photo of your
        Seed Phrase in the box and restore your wallet when they got off work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 25th word protects you in situations like this.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>How to Secure your 25th Word</h3>
<p>
    Your 25th word <i>can</i> be stored digitally using a password manager like LastPass or
    1Password. <b>NEVER STORE YOUR 25TH WORD WITH YOUR SEED PHRASE!</b>
</p>
<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    If someone is able to obtain your 25th word, it's pretty worthless unless they also know the
    entire seed phrase. This is why you should never store your 25th word with your offline
    seed phrase.
</p>

<h2>Add a PIN to your Hardware Wallet</h2>
<p>
    Every hardware wallet requires a PIN. You should choose a 6-digit PIN (or longer if possible) that you must enter
    to access coins in your crypto hardware wallet.
</p>
<p>
    You may need to enter your PIN several times when performing operations with your wallet.
</p>
<h3>How to Secure your PIN</h3>
<p>
    Your 25th word can also be stored digitally using a password manager like LastPass or
    1Password. You should <b>NOT</b> write down your PIN.
</p>
<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    Anyone who has physical access to your active hardware wallet can access and remove your
    funds if they know your PIN. This is why it should be safe to keep it stored in a cloud-based
    password manager. Hackers from half-way around the world wouldn't be a threat to being able
    to connect your hardware wallet to their USB port, so storing your PIN in the cloud is just
    fine.
</p>

<h2>Advanced Tips for Securing Your Hardware Wallet</h2>

<h3>Use a Decoy (Non-Hidden) Wallet</h3>
<p>
    If you use a 25th word, then if someone found your full 24-Word Seed Phrase, then if a
    theif were to recover your wallet, they would see it would be empty. If they knew about
    25th word security, they might go through the efforts of trying to find out the 25th
    word.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine a scenario where home invaders (who know you have crypto) tie you up and break
    open your safe. In your safe, they find a sheet of paper with your 24-Word phrase. Being
    knowledgable about crypto, they restore the phrase and find a wallet with no crypto.
</p>
<p>
    Since they know your Seed Phrase is valid, they might use physical force to get you to
    surrender the 25th word, which would allow them to access all your coin.
</p>
<p>
    But if you put a fraction of your crypto (1% to 5%) in the main wallet associated with
    your 24-Word Seed Phrase, then when they recover the wallet, they may believe they found
    your main stash. They may not go through the extra effort of trying to find your 25th
    word if they think they already hit the jackpot.
</p>

<h3>Don't Write Your 24-Word Phrase in the Correct Order</h3>
<p>
    Remember in <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, when the Nazis were able to copy the
    instructions for creating the <b>Staff of Ra</b>, which was used in the map room
    in Tannis to find the Ark? The Nazis only copied part of the instructions and didn't
    have an important piece of the puzzle (the back side of Ravenwood's medallion) which
    said to cut part of the staff.
</p>
<p>
    You can do something similar with your 24-Word Seed Phrase. Write it down in order
    with one or two words reversed or replaced. Then in a password manager, include
    instructions on what changes to make when restoring the wallet. If a bad actor finds
    your physical copy of your 
</p>

<h3>Use a Decoy PIN</h3>
<p>
    You might write down a fake or invalid PIN somewhere near your physical hardware wallet.
    If you do this, write down the longest number that is still valid as a PIN length for your
    device. And make sure you make a few of the numbers ambiguous ("Is that a '1' or a '7'? Is
    that a '6' or a '0'?"). Most hardware wallets make you wait a while between PIN entries,
    getting exponentially longer between unsuccessful attempts. Also, there is usually an
    upper limit to attempts, with the device wipiing itself when the user makes too many
    bad attempts in a row.
