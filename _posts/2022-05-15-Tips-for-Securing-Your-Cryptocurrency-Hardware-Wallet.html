    What's the best way of keeping your cryptocurrency wallet secure? There are <i>three major steps</i>
    that you should be taking in keeping your crypto safe.
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create and Secure a 24-Word Seed Phrase
        </li>
        <li>
            Add and Secure a "25th" Word to your Seed Phrase
        </li>
        <li>
            Use and Secure your PIN
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>Create and SECURE a 24-Word Seed Phrase</h2>
<p>
    The first step in securing your hardware wallet is to create a secure seed phrase. Even though
    shorter phrases are available, use the 24 word option, which is (obviously) the most
    secure.
</p>
<p>
    Seed phrases used with hardware wallets are based on the BIP-39 specificiation, so they are
    meant to be (mostly) interchangable amongst compatible hardware wallets.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-15/01-bip39-word-list-500x368.png" alt="BIP-39 Word List"/>
    <figcaption>
        You should use a 24-Word Seed Phrase. This is preferable over the shorter and less-secure
        12 and 18 word phrases.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    There are 2048 words to choose from, so selecting a 12, 18, or 24 word seed phrase will result in a
    cosmicly large number of possible permutations. The number of possible 24 word phrases is roughly
    equivalent to <i>30% of the number of atoms in the known universe</i>!
</p>
<p>
    This 2048 word list is indexed, so when you are given a word, you've really just given an ordinal
    position on this list. So, if you speak Spanish, the corresponding word will be a different word
    with a different meaning, but will have the same numeric position in the Spanish list. This is done
    in an effort to support users of every language.

<h3>How to Secure your Seed Phrase</h3>
<p>
    <b>NEVER</b> store your Seed Phrase electronically in <b>ANY FORM</b>. This means you need to
    write it down on paper, or better yet, you should scribe it or stamp it on metal. This copy of your
    Seed Phrase should be stored in a home safe or a safety deposit box.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        There are several <i>must do</i> steps in securing your cryptocurrency wallet. Make sure
        you're doing them.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    This <i>also</i> means that you should not take a picture of it! Digital photos often end up
    on a Cloud server (either purposely or accidentally), where they can be scanned with OCR
    software and easily checked for words on the seed phrase list.
</p>
<p>
    And for this same reason, you should make sure you don't write the phrase down within visibility
    of a security camera, even within your own home.
</p>
<p>
    You should avoid recording your Seed Phrase in any of the following formats:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Any digital text file or word processing file
        </li>
        <li>
            In a Password Manager like LastPass or 1Password
        </li>
        <li>
            A photo of any format - digital or even print
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    Any person who has access to your Seed Phrase can recreate your wallet
    <i>without requiring physical access to your hardware wallet AND without knowing your PIN</i>.
    They can access all the crypto in your (main) wallet. This is why protecting your
    Seed Phrase is the most important step in securing your hardware wallet.
</p>
<p>
    Phishing scams that get crypto holders to volunteer their seed phrase are amongst the
    most common of crypto scams and have resulted in the looting of
    <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/15/celsius-suffers-third-party-data-breach-customers-report-phishing-texts-emails/" target="_blank">millions of dollars</a>
    worth of crypto. You need to ensure you keep your seed phrase 100% offline.
</p>
<p>
    And you should be extremely cautious about storing your seed phrase in a bank
    safe deposit box.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-15/03-nyt-safe-deposit-boxes-600x336.png" alt="NYT Article: Safe Deposit Boxes Aren't Safe"/>
    <figcaption>

        safe deposit box from a non-paying customer.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Not only is the seed phrase seceptible to "legal" seizure by law enforcement, it is also
    seceptible to theft from a bank employee with a drill or even just a careless employee who
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html" target="_blank">seizes the contents of the wrong box</a>.
</p>
<p>
    A seed phrase stored with a third party isn't safe unless you combine
    the next security measure (the 25th word).
</p>

<h2>Add a "25th" Word to your Seed Phrase</h2>
<p>
    The major hardware wallets all support a "25th" word. This can be used to create a "hidden"
    wallet (or multiple hidden wallets, if you desire). This is a passphrase of your own choosing,
    and isn't limited to the 2048 word list in the above seed phrase.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">

    <figcaption>
        Use a 25th word or "passphrase" to unlock a hidden wallet or wallets.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    The 25th word protects your crypto from falling into the wrong hands if someone gets a hold
    of your Seed Phrase. If you were to keep that list in a safe deposit box, any banker
    with the authority to force open boxes (which can happen when you lose the key or if law
    enforcement tells them to).
</p>

<div class="infobox-info">
    If there is a "reasonable" suspicion that illegal items may be in a safe deposit box,
    law enforcement officials can obtain a court order to freeze the owner's access to
    it. In criminal cases investigators can force the box open and seize its contents.
    They don't even need to seize the contents - they might just snap a photo of your
    Seed Phrase and restore your wallet when they got off work.
    <br/><br/>
    The 25th word protects you in situations like this.
</div>

<h3>How to Secure your 25th Word</h3>
<p>
    Your 25th word may be stored <i>digitally</i> using a password manager like LastPass or
    1Password. <b>NEVER STORE YOUR 25TH WORD WITH YOUR SEED PHRASE!</b>
</p>
<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    If someone is able to obtain your 25th word, it's pretty worthless unless they also know the
    entire seed phrase. This is why you should never store your seed phrase and your 25th word
    together.
</p>

<h2>Add a PIN to your Hardware Wallet</h2>
<p>
    Every hardware wallet requires a PIN. You should choose a 6-digit PIN (or longer if possible) that you must enter
    to access coins in your crypto hardware wallet.
</p>
<p>
    You may need to enter your PIN several times when performing operations with your wallet.
</p>
<h3>How to Secure your PIN</h3>
<p>
    Your 25th word may also be stored <i>digitally</i> using a password manager like LastPass or
    1Password. You should <b>NOT</b> write down your PIN.
</p>
<figure class="figure-condensed">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-15/05-pin-398x599.jpg" alt="Protect your hardware wallet with a PIN"/>
    <figcaption>
        A PIN will protect your initialized hardware device.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Exposure</h3>
<p>
    Anyone who has physical access to your active hardware wallet can access and remove your
    funds if they know your PIN. This is why it should be safe to keep it stored in a cloud-based
    password manager. Hackers from half-way around the world wouldn't be a threat to being able
    to connect your hardware wallet to their USB port, so storing your PIN in the cloud is just
    fine.
</p>
<p>
    It's crucial to understand that a PIN <i>ONLY</i> protects you if your physical hardware
    wallet falls into the wrong hands. If a bad actor knows your seed phrase and your 25th word
    (assuming that you've set this), then they can re-create your wallet without ever knowing your
    PIN.
</p>

<h2>Advanced Tips for Securing Your Hardware Wallet</h2>
<p>
    Along with the three above security measures, there are additional tactics you can use to
    keep your crypto safe.
</p>

<h3>Use a Metal Seed Phrase Storage Kit</h3>
<p>
    
</p>

<h3>Use a Decoy (Non-Hidden) Wallet</h3>
<p>
    If you use a 25th word, then if someone found your full 24-Word Seed Phrase, then if a
    thief were to recover your wallet, they would see it would be empty. If they knew about
    25th word security, they might go through the efforts of trying to find out the 25th
    word.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine a scenario where home invaders (who know you have crypto) tie you up and break
    open your safe. In your safe, they find a sheet of paper with your 24-Word phrase. Being
    knowledgable about crypto, they restore the phrase and find a wallet with no crypto.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2022-05-15/06-decoy-1024x683.jpg" alt="Decoys work with Crypto Wallets, too!"/>
    <figcaption>
        If you have a fake/decoy wallet with a small fraction of your fortune in it, it could
        save you from financial ruin as well as physical harm.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    Since they know your Seed Phrase is valid, they might use physical force to get you to
    surrender the 25th word, which would allow them to access all your crypto.
</p>
<p>
    But if you put a fraction of your crypto (perhaps 1% to 5%) in the main wallet associated with
    your 24-Word Seed Phrase, then when they recover the wallet, they may believe they found
    your main stash. They may not go through the extra effort of trying to find your 25th
    word if they think they already hit the jackpot.
</p>

<h3>Don't Write Your 24-Word Phrase in the Correct Order</h3>
<p>
    In <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, Nazis were able to copy the
    instructions for creating the <b>Staff of Ra</b>, which was used in the map room
    in Tannis to find the Ark of the Covenant. But the Nazis only copied part of the
    instructions and didn't have an important piece of the puzzle (the back side of
    Ravenwood's medallion) which said to cut part of the staff.
</p>
<p>
    You can do something similar with your 24-Word Seed Phrase. Write it down in order
    with one or two words reversed in order or replaced. Then in a password manager, include
    instructions on what changes to make when restoring the wallet. If a bad actor finds
    your physical copy of your seed phrase, if they try to restore your wallet, they'll
    be "digging in the wrong place!" Bonus points if you spinkle some cyrpto-dust into
    the decoy wallet.

<h3>Use a Decoy PIN</h3>
<p>
    It's a pretty common tactic to write a fake PIN on your bank's ATM card. If your card
    is lost or stolen, a thief might try to use your card and withdraw funds. But if you
    write a fake PIN on your card, the thief could try to use it, and after several failed
    attempts to access your account, your card would be automatically locked in accordance
    with bank security policy.
</p>

    <figcaption>
        A decoy PIN can increase the liklihood that a thief can't access your hardware wallet. 
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    You might write down a fake or invalid PIN somewhere near your physical hardware wallet.
    If you do this, write down the longest number that is still valid as a PIN length for your
    device. And make sure you make a few of the numbers ambiguous (Is that a '1' or a '7'? Is
    that a '6' or a '0'?).
</p>
<p>
    Most hardware wallets make you wait a while between PIN entries, with your wait time
    growing exponentially longer between unsuccessful attempts. Also, there is usually an
    upper limit to attempts, with the device wipiing itself when the user makes too many
    bad attempts in a row. A decoy PIN can help accelerate the activation of this self-destruct
    mechanism.
