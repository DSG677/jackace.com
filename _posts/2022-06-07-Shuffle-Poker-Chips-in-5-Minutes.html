<p>
    If you play live poker, you <i>must</i> know how to shuffle poker chips. If you don't,
    can you even claim to be a real poker player?
</p>

<p>
    Brad Owen shuffles his chips.<br/>
    Rampage shuffles his chips.<br/>
    Even Poker Bunny shuffles her chips.
</p>

<p>
    So if you want to be taken seriously at the live poker table, you have to learn, too.
</p>

<h2>What do you need to Shuffle Poker Chips?</h2>
<p>
    To learn how to shuffle poker chips, you need three things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The proper materials</li>
    <li>Preparation</li>
    <li>Proper technique</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Most of the tutorials I've seen only talk about technique. That's usually fine if you're
    planning on practicing at a casino, but most people will be learning at home.
</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>
    There are two material items you need to shuffle poker chips:
    <ul>
        <li>Quality Poker Chips</li>
        <li>A Padded Surface</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Quality Poker Chips</h3>
<p>
    This is the obvious item, but it helps if you use chips that have a bit of wear and tear to
    them. It <i>really</i> helps.
</p>

<h4>Metal Dollar Tokens</h4>
<p>
    If you can get your hands on 8 of the old-school Vegas slot tokens, that is the absolute
    easiest type of chip you can start with. They are usually well weathered and are easy to
    shuffle. You basically just need to push them together and they'll shuffle themselves. It
    is a great way to get the feel of how the chips should be coming together and interleaving.
</p>

<h4>Real Casino Chips</h4>
<p>
    If you can get 8 non-slippery casino chips, they work best. Since they've presumably been
    used in a casino, they probably have natural wear-and-tear, which is great for learning
    how to shuffle.
</p>

<h4>Standard "Home Game" Poker Chips</h4>
<p>
    And the poker chips commonly used in "home games" and available for relatively cheap on Amazon
    work well, too. Just make sure you break them in using techniques in the <i>preparation</i>
    part of this post.
</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>
    There are three main steps in preparing to shuffle chips.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wash the chips</li>
    <li>Wash your hands</li>
    <li>Prepare your area   </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is an often overlooked step in learning chip shuffling. Any oil in your hands is going to
    make learning a lot more difficult. Also, new poker chips will often have a fine powder on them,
    which makes precise handling of the chips hard.
</p>
<p>
    So wash your hands well before you start practicing. I would also have some hand wipes to give
    your hands a quick rinse if you build up any oil in your hands while practicing. Trust me,
    this is going to help you a lot more than you might realize.
</p>
<p>
    And wipe the chips down, as well. New home game chips will have a fine dust on them that makes
    pushing them together more difficult. Old casino chips will often have oil on them from being
    man-handled for so long.
</p>

<h3>Prepare your area</h3>
<p>
    After 
</p>


<h2>Technique</h2>
<p>
    You should learn how to shuffle chips in the following order:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shuffle 2+2 Metal Dollar Slugs (if available)</li>
    <li>Shuffle 4+4 Metal Dollar Slugs (if available)</li>
    <li>Shuffle 2+2 Poker Chips</li>
    <li>Shuffle 4+4 Poker Chips</li>
    <li>Shuffle 8+8 Poker Chips</li>
    <li>Shuffle 4+4 Chips (Hard Mode)</li>
    <li>Shuffle 8+8 Chips (Hard Mode)</li>
    <li><b>BONUS:</b> Repeat all these steps for your non-dominant hand (I did for this post!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shuffling Metal Dollar Slugs</h3>
<p>
    If you can get a hold of some old school metal dollar slugs that casinos used to use in slot
    machines, they are excellent for getting a feel for the shuffle.
</p>
<p>
    The edges are usually well-worn and you can basically just squeeze the tokens together and
    they will magically interleave.
