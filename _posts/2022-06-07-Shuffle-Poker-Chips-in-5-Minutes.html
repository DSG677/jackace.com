<p>
    If you play live poker, you <i>must</i> know how to shuffle poker chips. If you don't,
    can you even claim to be a real poker player?
</p>

<p>
    Brad Owen shuffles his chips.<br/>
    Rampage shuffles his chips.<br/>
    Even Poker Bunny shuffles her chips.
</p>

<p>
    So if you want to be taken seriously at the live poker table, you have to learn, too.
</p>

<h2>What do you need to Shuffle Poker Chips?</h2>
<p>
    To learn how to shuffle poker chips, you need three things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The proper materials</li>
    <li>Preparation</li>
    <li>Technique</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Most of the tutorials I've seen only talk about technique. That's usually fine if you're
    planning on practicing at a casino, but most people will be learning at home.
</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>
    There are two material items you need to shuffle poker chips:
    <ul>
        <li>Quality Poker Chips</li>
        <li>A Padded Surface</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Quality Poker Chips</h3>
<p>
    This is the obvious item, but it helps if you use chips that have a bit of wear and tear to
    them. It <i>really</i> helps.
