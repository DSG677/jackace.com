<p>
    What are the best cards to use for your home game?
</p>
<p>
    It depends.
</p>

<p>
    What cards to use can vary greatly on what type of game you're hosting and
    the level of stakes you're playing.
</p>

<h3>Factors</h3>
<p>
    The type of cards you pick depends on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What game you're playing
    </li>
    <li>
        The stakes
    </li>
    <li>
        How often you plan on hosting
    </li>
    <li>
        and whether players may have any visual impairments
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>
    The above factors will determine:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The size
    </li>
    <li>
        The index
    </li>
    <li>
        The material
    </li>
    <li>
        The print
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Game(s)</h2>
<p>
    The type of game you're playing is a huge factor in what size deck to use.
</p>
<p>
    By default, you should use a <i>Standard Width</i> or <i>Poker Width</i> deck. This
    is the standard size you'd find online and even grocery stores, so if you don't go
    out of your way, this is what you'll probably get.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>only</i> reason for getting something other than Standard Width is if you are
    playing any <b>Trick-Based Games</b> or other <b>13-card Games</b>.
</p>
<p>
    A standard playing card is \(2 \frac{1}{2}\) inches wide by \(3 \frac{1}{2}\) inches
    in height.
</p>

<p>
    Trick-based games would include <i>Bridge</i>, <i>Hearts</i>, <i>Spades</i>, 
    and <i>Pinochle</i>. Of course, if you play Pinochle, you're probably already well
    schooled with what cards to get, because you're probably already buying the 
    48-card Pinochle deck.
</p>
<p>
    But for the other 52-card games listed above, you probably want to get a <i>Narrow Width</i>
    deck. This is also called a <i>Bridge-Sized</i> deck, for obvious reasons.
</p>
<p>
    These cards are usually 2 1/4" by 3 1/2".
</p>
<p>
    The narrow width of the deck makes it a lot easier to hold, especially if you're trying
    to fan out 13 cards at a time (the starting deal for most trick-based games).
