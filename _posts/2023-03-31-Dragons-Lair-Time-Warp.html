<p>
    The Dragon's Lair video game series was one of the biggest ground-breaking franchises of all time.
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        This blog post is a repost of something that I published in 2010. There are some minor
        corrections and copy changes.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    When I was a 11, my cousin, my brother and I would excuse ourselves after a hearty meal to go
    "jogging". In reality, we would skip over to the 7-11 to watch my 15 year-old cousin play Dragon's
    Lair (my brother and I were too young have our own quarters).
</p>
<p>
    If you don't know Dragons Lair, here are some of its vital stats:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It was one of the first video games that cost two quarters instead of one to play
    </li>
    <li>
        It was one of the first laser disc based video games
    </li>
    <li>
        It was animated by Don Bluth, creator of "An American Tail," "All Dogs go to Heaven," and "Anastasia."
    </li>
    <li>
        The short animated scenes were saved as tracks on the laser disc
    </li>
    <li>
        User input (limited to up, down, left, right and sword) determined which scene would play next.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you executed an incorrect action, another clip would play, where the main character, Dirk
        the Daring, dies.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The video game kind of worked like a modern (well...modern for 1983) 2-XL. If you don't remember
    the 2-XL, it was a trivia "robot" that was based on an 8-Track tape player. The robot would ask
    you questions with multiple choice answers. When you pressed the button corresponding with the
    correct/incorrect answer, the player would change tracks and tell you if you were right or not.
</p>
<p>
    My cousin could finish Dragon's Lair with one credit. That made him cooler than shit in my book.
    He would even die two times on purpose in the last scene to maximize his score (kind of like a
    cocky batter taking two strikes before hitting a pitch out of the park).
</p>
<p>
    When I was finally old enough to pay for my own video game habit, I saw an old friend with a new
    face -- Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp.
</p>
<p>
    I used to play it a lot at Ackerman Union at UCLA when I was a freshman. The game is great because
    the levels are themed and longer. The original game has dozens of short scenes where you would use
    the joystick or sword 5 or 6 times. Time Warp has 7 long levels where you have to execute dozens of
    actions.
</p>
<p>
    In this game, Princess Daphne is kidnapped my the evil wizard Mordor. While searching for her, Dirk
    the Daring runs into Mordor's brother, who happens to be a time machine. Dirk travels to different
    times and surreal lands (including through Lewis Carrol's Looking Glass) to destroy Mordor and
    reunite himself with the Princess.
</p>
<p>
    I just bought Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp for the PC off of eBay. My first contribution to the
    blogging world will be the complete dialog (with apologies for minor errors) from the game.
    Enjoy!
