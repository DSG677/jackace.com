# About Jack Hayes

Gambler. Mathematician. Engineer.

I've been posting *and* answering questions about gambling on the internet since 1994. I've been contributing
to Usenet newsgroups ([`rec.gambling.blackjack`](https://groups.google.com/g/rec.gambling.blackjack)

([Games & Recreation - Gambling](https://web.archive.org/web/20111027010015/http://answers.yahoo.com/dir/index?sid=396545375)),
and more recently, Reddit ([`/r/blackjack`](https://reddit.com/r/blackjack/) and [`/r/poker`](https://reddit.com/r/poker/)).
