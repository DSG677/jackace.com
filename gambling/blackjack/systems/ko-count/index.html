title: "The Knock-Out Card Counting System (KO Count)"
---

<p>
    The Knock-Out Counting System (a.k.a. the Unbalanced Knock-Out System or the KO Count), was invented
    by Ken Fuchs and Olaf Vancura Ph.D and was branded as the "Easiest Card Counting System Ever Devised".
</p>
<p>
    It was one of the first "unbalanced" counts. A system where totaling the values of all of the cards in
    a deck resulted in a number other than zero.
